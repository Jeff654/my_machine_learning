Paper puts forward a method that combine with polynomial kernel function and Marr wavelet kernel function. Three modeths has been proposed, which included the combination of Polynomial kernel function and Guassian kernel function, the combination of Guassian kernel function and sigmoid kernel function, the combination of Marr wavelet kernel function and sigmoid kernel function. Thanks to the dual-kernel function has the advantages of global function and local function properties, so it has nice learning ability and generalization ability. Finally, choosen representative Guassian kernel function, polynomial kernel function, Marr wavelet kernel function and four combination of kernel function, and then have experiment on the varieties of datasets, we conclude that under the circumstances of appropriate parameters, and compared their experimental results, the combination of Marr wavelet kernel function and polynomial kernel function has dramaticlly advantages on some finance datasets


Paper puts forward a method that using dual-kernel function to construct Support Vector Machine model, and then given a way of combining polynomial with Marr wavelet kernel function model, polynomial and Guassian kernel function model, Guassian and Sigmoid kernel function model, Marr wavelet with Sigmoid kernel function model. We make an experiments on above four models respectively, and then test its on the finance datasets, the results demonstrate that under the circumstance of appropriate parameters, the model which combine Marr wavelet with polynomial kernel function can make a good effect on prediction.
