Paper puts forward a method that combine with polynomial kernel function and Marr wavelet kernel function. Three modeths has been proposed, which included the combination of Polynomial kernel function and Guassian kernel function, the combination of Guassian kernel function and sigmoid kernel function, the combination of Marr wavelet kernel function and sigmoid kernel function. Thanks to the dual-kernel function has the advantages of global function and local function properties, so it has nice learning ability and generalization ability. Finally, choosen representative Guassian kernel function, polynomial kernel function, Marr wavelet kernel function and four combination of kernel function, and then have experiment on the varieties of datasets, we conclude that under the circumstances of appropriate parameters, and compared their experimental results, the combination of Marr wavelet kernel function and polynomial kernel function has dramaticlly advantages on some finance datasets
