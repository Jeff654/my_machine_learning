Joan decides to travel to Italy, in the company of her colleague, who offers his support. Once in Italy, she starts having visions relative to an ancient people and maggots, many maggots. After shootings and weird events, Joan realizes that her father is an international drug dealer, there are drugs hidden in the tomb and her colleague is a detective of the narcotic department. The story ends back in New York, when Joan and her colleague decide to get married with each other, in a very romantic end. Yesterday I had the displeasure of wasting my time watching this crap. The story is so absurd, mixing thriller, crime, supernatural and horror (and even a romantic end) in a non-sense way. The acting is the worst possible, highlighting the horrible performance of the beautiful Elvire Audrey. John Saxon just gives his name to the credits and works less than five minutes, when his character is killed. The special effects are limited to maggots everywhere. The direction is ridiculous. I lost a couple of hours of my life watching \\'Assassinio al Cimitero Etrusco\\'.

       "  '\"A plane carrying employees of a large biotech firm--including the CEO\\'s daughter--goes down in thick forest in the Pacific Northwest. When the search and rescue mission is called off, the CEO, Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen), puts together a small ragtag group to execute their own search and rescue mission. But just what is Knowles searching for and trying to rescue, and just what is following and watching them in the woods? <br /><br />Oy, what a mess this film was! It was a shame, because for one, it stars Lance Henriksen, who is one of my favorite modern genre actors, and two, it could have easily been a decent film. It suffers from two major flaws, and they\\'re probably both writer/director Jonas Quastel\\'s fault--this film (which I\\'ll be calling by its aka of Sasquatch) has just about the worst editing I\\'ve ever seen next to Alone in the Dark (2005), and Quastel\\'s constant advice for the cast appears to have been, \\\\\"Okay, let\\'s try that again, but this time I want everyone to talk on top of each other, improvise non-sequiturs and generally try to be as annoying as possible\\\\\".<br /><br />The potential was there. Despite the rip-off aspects (any material related to the plane crash was obviously trying to crib The Blair Witch Project (1999) and any material related to the titular monster was cribbing Predator (1987)), Ed Wood-like exposition and ridiculous dialogue, the plot had promise and potential for subtler and far less saccharine subtexts. The monster costume, once we actually get to see it, was more than sufficient for my tastes. The mixture of character types trudging through the woods could have been great if Quastel and fellow writer Chris Lanning would have turned down the stereotype notch from 11 to at least 5 and spent more time exploring their relationships. The monster\\'s \\\\\"lair\\\\\" had some nice production design, specifically the corpse decorations ala a more primitive Jeepers Creepers (2001). If it had been edited well, there were some scenes with decent dialogue that could have easily been effective.<br /><br />But the most frightening thing about Sasquatch is the number of missteps made: For some reason, Quastel thinks it\\'s a good idea to chop up dialogue scenes that occur within minutes of each other in real time so that instead we see a few lines of scene A, then a few lines of scene B, then back to A, back to B, and so on.<br /><br />For some reason, he thinks it\\'s a good idea to use frequently use black screens in between snippets of dialogue, whether we need the idea of an unspecified amount of time passing between irrelevant comments or whether the irrelevant comments seem to be occurring one after the other in time anyway.<br /><br />For some reason, he doesn\\'t care whether scenes were shot during the morning, afternoon, middle of the night, etc. He just cuts to them at random. For that matter, the scenes we\\'re shown appear to be selected at random. Important events either never or barely appear, and we\\'re stuck with far too many pointless scenes.<br /><br />For some reason, he left a scene about cave art in the film when it either needs more exposition to justify getting there, or it needs to just be cut out, because it\\'s not that important (the monster\\'s intelligence and \\\\\"humanity\\\\\" could have easily been shown in another way).<br /><br />For some reason, there is a whole character--Mary Mancini--left in the script even though she\\'s superfluous.<br /><br />For some reason we suddenly go to a extremely soft-core porno scene, even though the motif is never repeated again.<br /><br />For some reason, characters keep calling Harlan Knowles \\\\\"Mr. H\\\\\", like they\\'re stereotypes of Asian domestics.<br /><br />For some reason, Quastel insists on using the \\\\\"Blurry Cam\\\\\" and \\\\\"Distorto-Cam\\\\\" for the monster attack scenes, even though the costume doesn\\'t look that bad, and it would have been much more effective to put in some fog, a subtle filter, or anything else other than bad cinematography.<br /><br />I could go on, but you get the idea.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this film better than I did\\x97I\\'m a Henriksen fan, I\\'m intrigued by the subject, I loved the setting, I love hiking and this is basically a hiking film on one level--but I just couldn\\'t.

Seeing comments typical of people who a)know absolutely nothing about the military or b)who base everything they think they know on movies like this or on CNN reports about Abu-Gharib makes me wonder about the state of intellectual stimulation in the world.<br /><br />At the time I type this the number of people in the US military: 1.4 million on Active Duty with another almost 900,000 in the Guard and Reserves for a total of roughly 2.3 million.<br /><br />The number of people indicted for abuses at at Abu-Gharib: Currently less than 20<br /><br />That makes the total of people indicted .00083% of the total military. Even if you indict every single military member that ever stepped in to Abu-Gharib, you would not come close to making that a whole number. <br /><br />The flaws in this movie would take YEARS to cover. I understand that it\\'s supposed to be sarcastic, but in reality, the writer and director are trying to make commentary about the state of the military without an enemy to fight. In reality, the US military has been at its busiest when there are not conflicts going on. The military is the first called for disaster relief and humanitarian aid missions. When the tsunami hit Indonesia, devestating the region, the US military was the first on the scene. When the chaos of the situation overwhelmed the local governments, it was military leadership who looked at their people, the same people this movie mocks, and said make it happen. Within hours, food aid was reaching isolated villages. Within days, airfields were built, cargo aircraft started landing and a food distribution system was up and running. Hours and days, not weeks and months. Yes there are unscrupulous people in the US military. But then, there are in every walk of life, every occupation. But to see people on this website decide that 2.3 million men and women are all criminal, with nothing on their minds but thoughts of destruction or mayhem is an absolute disservice to the things that they do every day. One person on this website even went so far as to say that military members are in it for personal gain. Wow! Entry level personnel make just under $8.00 an hour assuming a 40 hour work week. Of course, many work much more than 40 hours a week and those in harm\\'s way typically put in 16-18 hour days for months on end. That makes the pay well under minimum wage. So much for personal gain. I beg you, please make yourself familiar with the world around you. Go to a nearby base, get a visitor pass and meet some of the men and women you are so quick to disparage. You would be surprised. The military no longer accepts people in lieu of prison time. They require a minimum of a GED and prefer a high school diploma. The middle ranks are expected to get a minimum of undergraduate degrees and the upper ranks are encouraged to get advanced degrees.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"It\\'s hard to describe Elfen Lied to someone who hasn\\'t heard of it; the closest I can think of is a strange mix of extreme violence, romance and drama. To those of you who haven\\'t witnessed it, you\\'re probably wondering how these are all incorporated into the one piece coherently. Those that have though, are instead pondering why they haven\\'t been put together sooner. Such is the quality and flow of this odd hybrid of an anime. <br /><br />The real area that Elfen Lied shines is it\\'s narrative - its hard not to be enthralled by its weaving course and diversity. A Violent and gory encounter will perhaps gives way to another with a contrasting lighter moment. Emotive drama gives way to bloodshed and then back again, only this time bring you close to tears as it does so. It\\'s a strange combination, where you as the viewer are thrown about and manipulated like those in the story line itself, but one that works surprisingly well. It does this all the while without feeling disjointed, it has an elegance and clever subtly when it makes these strong transitions that makes it all the more mesmorising.<br /><br />This is carefully finished with a truly memorable musical score, which in my opinion is another great strength. The opening \\'Lilium\\' is particularly powerful, and differing versions feature prominently throughout - lending its intensity to emotive scenes. However, regarding music there\\'s an off kilter over-happy pop song that plays over the credits after each episode. It feels out of place, but never the less is adequate enough, and it could be argued adds a good contrast to what is at times quite a depressing anime.<br /><br />I must reiterate however, that the violence is somewhat extreme, and I advise you to be prepared for it if you are faint hearted. However by no means avoid this because of it, there\\'s a lot more to it than the violence, and you will be denying yourself a truly wondrous experience by not watching it. It is to any fan of the medium unmissable; a weird cocktail of conflicting ideas - that on paper shouldn\\'t work, but some how is pulled off in spectacular fashion, gripping you from the start to it\\'s brutal conclusion. <br /><br />Still not convinced?

Anyway under the regime of Messiah Macaluso those who are not followers of his are deemed \\'haters\\' and are rounded up and also disappear in more conventional ways.<br /><br />Fahey finds himself questioning what\\'s going on and when he does he\\'s framed for his partner\\'s murder and forced to flee among the haters. Who in his city include former news anchor Leigh Lewis who in the first film had been the first to denounce Macaluso for being Satan.<br /><br />Mancuso\\'s got something called a Day of Wonders where folks will be asked to participate in a virtual reality game en masse. Since we know who Mancuso is, it\\'s something not good and its up to the believer types to throw a monkey wrench into the works. <br /><br />Carol Alt and Tony Nappo play a blind and a paraplegic people respectively and when they play the game they are healed and become Mancuso\\'s disciples. That\\'s a mighty hard thing to give up, healing from some affliction to reject Mancuso.<br /><br />David Roddis has an over the top performance as one of Mancuso\\'s acolytes who\\'s playing his villain in the best Snidely Whiplash tradition. All he needed was a handlebar mustache to twirl at both ends.<br /><br />It\\'s impossible to evaluate these films because believer folk will hang on every word and nonbelievers will inevitably scoff. Then it degenerates into a theological not a cinema discussion. The cast give it their best to inject reality in some far fetched notions.<br /><br />There was a scene that really wasn\\'t terribly germane to the plot where a father turns in his son for \\'re-education\\' because he caught him with a Bible. I took a look on the actor, Darrel Hicks, who played the son and found he\\'d also later done work on Queer As Folks. Talk about an eclectic resume.<br /><br />The ending is positively biblical itself. Just think of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.\"'],\n",

So, provided you understand that this isn\\'t quite a true story, this is still an exceptional film. Much of this is due to incredible acting, direction, scripting and makeup.<br /><br />Henri Charriere, played by Steve McQueen, is going to Devil\\'s Island for killing a pimp--supposedly in self-defense. On the boat, he meets a swindler played by Dustin Hoffman and they become friends.<br /><br />Most of the film documents how harsh and awful life is in the prison came--either in the work camps or when living in solitary confinement. All take their toll and kill off many of the prisoners, by Charriere is resilient. Despite all these privations, he never loses his resolve to escape, though Hoffman eventually does and accepts his life on the island after one failed escape attempt. In the end, Charriere does escape, though in real-life, this apparently did NOT occur.<br /><br />While there is a lot more to the movie and what I have mentioned (after all it\\'s a very long and involved film), the full impact of the story is not what you read but seeing the awfulness of the prison.

Gertrude Lawrence is the mother who was abandoned by her husband and has been reduced to living in a dumpy apartment and selling magazine subscriptions.

Many great actresses have been associated with the role of Amanda Wingfield since this play made its Broadway debut in the 1940s: Laurette Taylor, Katharine Hepburn, Joanne Woodward, Maureen Stapletobm Jessica Tandy, Julie Harris, and Jessica Lange have all played the role on stage, film, or TV. And I swear I remember Shirley Booth doing this on TV also.<br /><br />Ultimetaely the story is as fragile as the glass figures. If any one character dominates the story the whole play collapses. This film version works very well in balancing the roles. And while Wyman seems a tad old for the part, Lawrence was an even odder choice. I\\'ve also read that Bette Davis and Tallulah Bankhead were considered. But how they decided on Lawrence--a great musical comedy star in London and New York--is anyone\\'s guess.

It has only powerhouse actors in it, the movie doesn\\'t just have one main character, it follows multiple story lines from all the different characters and it has an excellent written story. Don\\'t let the fact that this is just a \\'made for TV\\' movie scare you of. The only reason the movie didn\\'t got a theatrical release is because Dutch cinema in general is not very popular by the main stream audience and besides movies like this just don\\'t do well in Dutch cinema\\'s, regardless of the language spoken. A shame because that also in a way means that not too often Dutch movies like \\\\\"Cloaca\\\\\" will ever be made and released. This movie however truly screams for more.<br /><br />The story at first starts of rather simple but just like in real life things are more complicated than they at first seem. Every character in the movie has problem(s) on their own and the one thing that connects everything is their friendship. The four old college buddies, now in their forties, try to help each other but have to cope with their own difficulties as well. By helping each other out they discover the true meaning of friendship and start evaluation the way their lives are progressing thus far and where things went wrong for them and they let the \\'good old times\\' revive as well. It\\'s a real character movie and a movie like this always requires some extremely good actors. \\\\\"Cloaca\\\\\" really has this. It makes the movie, the story and the situations in this all feel very real and understandable.<br /><br />\\\\\"Cloaca\\\\\" has the best acting you\\'ll probably ever see in a Dutch movie. All of the actors in this movie are well taught and established actors, who appear mostly on the stage. It\\'s too bad that Dutch movies not too often give the chance to let actors like this shine on the silver screen. Ductch cinema doesn\\'t often offer roles like these to actors of this caliber. Pierre Bokma, Gijs Scholten van Aschat and Pierre Bokma are all probably the best Dutch actors at the moment. It also definitely helps the movie that the three of them are real life friends and went to college together (along with the movie its director Willem van de Sande Bakhuyzen), it definitely shows on screen, since they all have such a great chemistry and share some great anticipation and reaction with each other. It lifts their performances to an even higher level and makes the timing spot on.<br /><br />The movie is deliberately kept low key. No fancy tricks are used and the movie mostly relies on telling its story purely through its characters. It\\'s based on a stage play by Maria Goos, which starred for most part the same actors that also appear in this movie. It means that the movie also feels \\'stagey\\' at times, with its characters and dialog. This doesn\\'t always work out well in movies but there are exceptions and when there are exceptions, they are always brilliant ones. \\\\\"Cloaca\\\\\" is a wonderful example of this. It\\'s a real shame by the way that the British Kevin Spacey stage play version wasn\\'t an huge success.<br /><br />The movie is extremely well directed by Willem van de Sande Bakhuyzen. Of course the storytelling is slow but van de Sande Bakhuyzen\\'s directing keeps the pace always high and the movie interesting. The movie also has some beautiful cinematography and a suiting musical score. A real lost for Dutch cinema, that Willem van de Sande Bakhuyzen died in 2005 of cancer.

Also the crude language and the oh-too-much \\\\\"crotch\\\\\" view makes it quite impossible to let your kids watch the movie, which is a pity, because I find the hilarious fight scenes and the Zohan\\'s \\\\\"supernatural\\\\\" cool stunts would have been fun for kids to watch.<br /><br />Second point of view would be from an Arab point of view; I started watching this movie, preparing myself to get offended, and mind you I am a very broad minded person ... However, I was pleasantly surprised, for the first time in my life I see a movie that does not picture Arabs as animal-like, heartless, brainless killing machines. They are just people, trying to make a living, even the avenging one has a reason, the Zohan stole his goat.<br /><br />Watching this movie, I tried to forget that I am an Arab, and I see that it is portraying - in a very silly and somehow inaccurate way - two opposing sides, and suggesting that they stop fighting, get over their differences to see that they are in fact similar.<br /><br />The movie makers get my personal \\\\\"thank you\\\\\" for that, it is no different than watching a movie about the conflict between \\\\\"black\\\\\" and \\\\\"white\\\\\" people after the civil war, or about Americans and Japanese directly after WWII, there is no prejudices against Arabs here.<br /><br />For the very first time, someone has discovered that Arabs are human beings too.

       "  '\"Hollywood insider films have been made since the movie colony came out to the west coast. The Hollywood community was aware that the public knew their patented make-believe was just that, and so they were willing to share the \\\\\"truth\\\\\" about Hollywood with the public fairly often.<br /><br />But these films got darker in the late 1940s and early 1950s. In 1950 Billy Wilder\\'s SUNSET BOULEVARD showed how the world had forgotten it\\'s celebrities and stars of the late silent period a generation earlier. In 1951, although ostensibly a comedy, SINGING IN THE RAIN did show the disaster to so many silent careers (even the detestable Lila Lamont\\'s) that sound brought in it\\'s wake. Yet with all the viewing of the effect of the film industry\\'s changes on the lives of actors, few tackled that of production people.<br /><br />Vincent Minelli\\'s 1952 THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL did just that, studying the career of a super film producer. It\\'s use of organized series of flashbacks reminds of that this film\\'s producer was John Houseman, once the partner of Orson Welles in his Mercury Theater. The constant comment that the anti-hero of the film, \\\\\"Jonathan Shields\\\\\" (Kirk Douglas) is dismissed as a \\\\\"genius\\\\\" is like the disparagement shown to boy-genius Welles when he showed up in Hollywood. But the basic model for the producer seems to be David O. Selznick, whose father was prominent in the 1920s, until forced out by rivals in the industry. Jonathan\\'s father was also a big shot until he too was thrown out by his rivals.<br /><br />Briefly the plot of the story is how Shields made a career out of the work of other people, several of whom he hurt by discarding as soon as he could. First is his co-producer/director Fred Amiel (Barry Sullivan), whose treatment plan for a major film is taken from him by Shields to sell the studio on backing it. Amiel hoped to direct it, but it is directed instead by Von Ellstein (Ivan Triesaut - a kind of clone of Josef Von Sternberg). Amiel breaks with Shields as a result, and never will work for him again. However, Amiel is able within a few years to be one of the most successful Hollywood directors anyway.<br /><br />That incident was in 1936 (a film preview is shown at a theater showing ANNA KARENINA with Garbo and Fredric March - an MGM film, just like this one). In 1941 Shields is casting the leading role for a film to be shot by Harry Whitfield (Leo G. Carroll - possibly a clone of Alfred Hitchcock). He decides to hire \\\\\"Georgia Lorison\\\\\" (Lana Turner) for the female lead opposite \\\\\"Gaucho\\\\\" (Gilbert Roland). Lorison is the daughter of a classic leading actor of the past (his voice is heard - it is Louis Calhern\\'s), who died impoverished and an alcoholic wreck (the father and daughter are supposed to be John and Diane Barrymore). Georgia is trying to keep off the sauce herself, and falls on the day shooting is to begin. Since Jonathan learns that Georgia loves him, he romances her. It is only when the film is in the can that he breaks it off, rather roughly. Georgia\\'s performance makes her a success in Hollywood, but she never will work for Jonathan again.<br /><br />Finally we have the story of novelist James Lee Barlow (Dick Powell) and his wife Rosemary (Gloria Grahame). Barlow is in Hollywood to write the screenplay version of his best selling novel of the deep south (he\\'s a clone for William Faulkner and Thomas Wolfe, with some F.Scott Fitzgerald in). As Rosemary keeps James Lee from working, Jonathan tries to get the author into isolation to work, and preoccupies Rosemary with Gaucho (who had come onto her at a party). But Gaucho and Rosemary are killed in a plane crash. James Lee finishes the script, but an argument between Jonathan and Von Ellstein causes the latter to quit the film. Jonathan ruins the film because he has no talent as a director. Still he and James Lee might work on a new project together, but a stupid remark by Jonathan causes James Lee to realize that Gaucho and Rosemary were together on that ill-fated trip due to Jonathan. So he too leaves the producer. But subsequently he writes a novel about his wife, and wins a Pulitzer Prize.<br /><br />Called together by Jonathan\\'s financial head, Harry Pebble (Walter Pidgeon), the three victims of Shields refuse a new offer for just one final picture with him. But at the conclusion they all show curiosity on just what the new idea of his is.<br /><br />THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL had a wonderful script - it has many intricate bits in it that one has to catch on repeated viewings. Pebble (originally Shields\\' boss) dismisses him until he sees the treatment of the novel that Amiel wrote - he thinks it is Shields\\' ideas). He says in front of a seething Fred Amiel he always thought Shields a genius. Later, of course, he realizes it was not Jonathan\\'s work. Similarly Von Ellstein congratulates Jonathan on being the first producer whose treatment of a book resembles the work of a director. Later he too realizes it was Fred\\'s work, and ironically the collapse of Jonathan\\'s position is begun when Von Ellstein lectures Jonathan on how you can\\'t just stuff a film with a series of climaxes but have to build to one. Also the first time Georgia and James Lee discuss a film script they accidentally (by lack of knowledge on his part, and by temporary failure of memory on hers) hurt each other without realizing it. It becomes a rich tapestry of the industry and the various lives that get involved in it. As such it is one of the best films about movie making ever made.\"'],\n",

With her insinuating laugh and sophisticated but down-to-earth manner, she is a wonderful screwball heroine, even if she lacks the haughty glamour of Katharine Hepburn or the brazen beauty of Carole Lombard.<br /><br />Here Dunne plays Ellen Wagstaff Arden returning home after seven years shipwrecked on a desert island. The problem is that her husband Nick has just gotten remarried to a high maintenance socialite named Bianca. Further complications ensue when it\\'s disclosed that Ellen was not alone on the island and that her companion was an athletic Adonis named Stephen Burkett, of course a bachelor. The ending is obvious from the beginning, but there are some hilarious set pieces along the way, in particular, when Ellen recruits a timid shoe salesman to impersonate Stephen and also when her ruse is exposed as the real Stephen pops up from the country club swimming pool. In 1940, the same year he made classics like \\\\\"The Philadelphia Story\\\\\" and \\\\\"His Girl Friday\\\\\", Grant is at the top of his game, and Dunne matches him every step of the way. It does seem a bit of a stretch to think that the principal characters would be celibate for seven long years, but such was 1930\\'s Hollywood convention.<br /><br />Randolph Scott gamely plays the dumb-as-dirt Stephen, an ironic choice given the rumors of the actor\\'s relationship with Grant. As Bianca, the glamorously venomous Gail Patrick - expert at such roles from classics like \\\\\"My Man Godfrey\\\\\" and \\\\\"Stage Door\\\\\" - knows her fate in the movie but doesn\\'t really show her talons until the courtroom scene.

Could it get any better?<br /><br />Well, THAT\\'S ENTERTAINMENT II certainly tries its darned hardest to be better. Not a single clip is repeated from the first film in the trilogy, and watching this film really makes you realise just how much talent was all focused in the one studio from the 30s through to the 50s. Judy Garland admiring Fred Astaire\\'s Easter bonnet in EASTER PARADE, Garland and Astaire sailing up the avenue as \\'A Couple Of Swells\\' in the same film, Gene Kelly and Garland dueting on FOR ME AND MY GAL, Ann Miller and Bob Fosse in KISS ME KATE, a montage of musicals before colour, a Garland tribute, a Spencer Tracy/Katharine Hepburn love-fest... this film unabashedly brings them all (and much much more) together. There are a couple of clunkers, of course, like Bobby Van hopping like a maniacal rabbit-freak through the town, or the token Esther Williams number. But as you listen to Garland sing \\'Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\\', or Frank Sinatra croon his way through \\'I Fall In Love Too Easily\\', and see Gene tap dance on skates as naturally as if he had been born with them strapped on... again you\\'re struck with just how special an era this was in film-making, one that unfortunately is lost to the rest of us except through video and DVD.<br /><br />And I know that this isn\\'t the most popular of opinions, but I think THAT\\'S ENTERTAINMENT II not only matches but far surpasses the original. There was nothing special about the first film--its only gimmick was the coup it had managed in bringing all these glorious film legends back together to talk about their work. The only caveat was that the incredible personalities behind the stars just couldn\\'t shine through except with some pretty special people... otherwise, they were all reading off a pre-written script. Kind of dampening, really. <br /><br />THAT\\'S ENTERTAINMENT II, on the other hand, is a small but successful exercise in creativity: from the title sequence through to Gene Kelly\\'s direction of the new footage between himself and Astaire. It\\'s also a delight for fans of both Astaire and Kelly when these two dancing men, you know... dance together again. Sure, they\\'re not as nimble and quicksilver as they used to be, and some of the lyrics they\\'re singing are--well, the only word for it is corny. But there\\'s no denying that both these men have a kind of screen charisma that doesn\\'t disappear with time, and having them both onscreen together, singing... now that really *is* entertainment as it should be. In the final scene they tell us that the best films have the audience leaving the film with a glow. How right they are.<br /><br />Quite simply, THAT\\'S ENTERTAINMENT II is sheer, perfect nostalgia bottled and kept simmering, just waiting for an audience.

Snow, fjords, and Norwegian towns and scenery were really pretty, as were the folk costumes. <br /><br />2. Grieg\\'s music was nice to listen to, though as in all films about composers, they only give samplings.<br /><br />Those are the good parts. The bad parts were what sank the boat. There wasn\\'t much of a story. Greig\\'s life wasn\\'t as exciting as many other composers lives, and a lot was padded to keep the story going for 2 or 3 hours. I remember a lot of overacting as well. But the worst part of all was the directing. Forever emblazoned upon my memory is the hideously clichéd scene where Grieg, his wife, and someone else spread their arms and run across a green field, stop on a hillock, and spin around to face the audience. Then they do the same thing again - and again! If that\\'s not enough to make you give up, then nothing is.\"'],\n",

Admittedly, he is helped in this goal by the obnoxious loudmouth and light-on-brains Mike, who, whether by accident or design, is made even more repulsive than the screenplay requires by the over-enthusiastic acting of Dale Belding. Fortunately, when the script gives her a chance, Mary Beth Hughes comes to the rescue with her animated portrait of the girl who wants to escape her small town \\\\\"prison\\\\\".<br /><br />In keeping with the nocturnal atmosphere of the radio series, most of the action takes place at night. However, although the picture is big on atmosphere, despite its obviously limited budget, it is somewhat deficient in characterization and motivation. The screenplay overstates the one-dimensional comic interludes, but dwells little on the forces that drive the main characters. Why does Russell murder the girl? Is it an accident? Self-defense?

       "  '\"I\\'m not sure how to describe this bizarre, but beautiful movie.<br /><br />First, it\\'s long. Just one minute under three hours. And it\\'s not exactly fast-paced either. If sci-fi for you means action, spaceships and interplanetary intrigue, give this one a miss. In fact, although the cover describes it as \\\\\"The cult BBC Science Fiction film\\\\\", I\\'d hesitate to call it science fiction; indeed, I\\'d hesitate to label it anything at all.<br /><br />And it\\'s definitely flawed. The dialogue is riddled with melodrama and pretentious poetry; the camera-work sophomoric, and the editing clumsy. And yet the effect shines through: the movie has an eerie, otherworldly quality, where trivial details (such as an old lady glaring at a noisy conversation in a library) seem to take on ominous significance.<br /><br />And so, if you have the patience, you\\'ll get sucked in to this movie. It\\'s mysterious, and beautiful. But don\\'t expect to come out satisfied. Although there is a plot, it is far from clear. The story moves from one surreal incident to another, each connected but seldom shedding any light on its predecessor; even at the end, when it appears that our protagonists have triumphed, it\\'s far from clear what exactly they\\'ve triumphed over, and most loose ends are left firmly untied.<br /><br />Hywel Bennett does a fine job as as the somewhat petulant author caught up in a situation that might have been co-written by Kafka and Philip K Dick. Dinah Stabb perhaps succumbs a little to her melodramatic script; Dan O\\'Herlihy brings an artistic gravitas to his role. A cameo from a very young Daniel Day-Lewis, and a supporting role by Sting, add a bit of celebrity interest.<br /><br />Overall, Artemis \\'81 reminded me more than anything of Twin Peaks (which was made nearly a decade later, and, curiously, also featured Dan O\\'Herlihy) - the same sense of explanation hidden just around the corner, and another reality just half-glimpsed and poorly understood.

And we\\'re told in flashback the dynamics of the relationships between Shields and each one.<br /><br />One thing about Tinseltown, they\\'ve never been afraid to show the seamier side of movie-making. Kirk Douglas\\'s Jonathan Shields is a not too thinly disguised version of David O. Selznick.

One of the things I like about this film is that all three stories, each in itself, could be expanded into a film all it\\'s own. <br /><br />Lana Turner\\'s role as the ersatz Diana Barrymore is not to hard to spot either. It\\'s so much better here than the film based on her own book Too Much Too Soon. If that voice of Turner\\'s actor father on those 78 rpms she\\'s playing sounds familiar, it\\'s that of Louis Calhern. Turner\\'s was a life lived out all too well in the tabloids and she brings all of it to bear in playing Gerogia Lorrison.<br /><br />Dick Powell, who was offered the lead as Jonathan Shields, opted to play tweedy professor turned screenwriter James Lee Barlow. This was Powell\\'s next to last feature picture as an actor, it should have been the one he went out on. Powell was always ahead of the industry\\'s cutting edge and he decided to concentrate more on directing and acting for the small screen.<br /><br />Powell\\'s segment includes Gloria Grahame as his flirty wife. Post World War II Hollywood, whenever it had a part for a tramp, first call Gloria Grahame. Here she responds with an Academy Award winning performance. She hasn\\'t many scenes, but as was said in another MGM picture around that time, what there is is cherce.<br /><br />I don\\'t think there\\'s ever been an actor who can go from zero to sixty on the emotional scale as quickly as Kirk Douglas. Check the scene when Lana Turner discovers how Douglas betrayed her. The intensity of his reaction alone is frightening and real. Douglas was also up for an Oscar, but it went that year to laconic Gary Cooper in High Noon.<br /><br />Vincente Minelli put all the pieces together just right and it comes out great entertainment.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"Decades ago, a crate filled with weapons grade plutonium crashes on an island and soaks into the ground. Today, a team of military men are sent to track down a notorious terrorist (of ambiguous national origin) and they track him to this polluted island. When their raft is destroyed, the team must spend the night on shore, but soon discover that the plutonium has done something awful to the island -- it has called forth hundreds of bloodthirsty velociraptors.<br /><br />Let me start this with a lesson: don\\'t lend a movie to your friend before you\\'ve seen it, especially if you are supposed to be reviewing it for the internet\\'s finest horror movie site. It took me almost a year to get this film back, and the person who borrowed it still had not watched it (though we ended up seeing it together). And a second, more important, lesson: when you do watch this, keep your expectations as low as humanly possible. Because this film ranks among the worst I\\'ve ever seen.<br /><br />My acting in 8th grade was more convincing than the seasoned actors who appear in this film (Lorenzo Lamas, Stephen Bauer). Line delivery is very fake, and the words themselves are poorly scripted. The opening words come from a man checking out his gun\\'s scope: \\\\\"Boom. Dead bad guys.\\\\\" Yes, that\\'s pure genius at work. The only conversation with any depth has two main characters explaining their histories. But it, too, seems unnatural and a poor attempt to provide character background and to fill time. We didn\\'t need to know anything about their histories, so why bore us with it? And if you think the conversations are bad, you ain\\'t seen nothing yet.<br /><br />The lighting is atrocious. I generally don\\'t notice lighting, but my friend (a former film school student) was practically vomiting in rage at the way more often than not shadows fell on the actors\\' faces and the light would be in the background, focused on nothing in particular. Most lighting looks like a spotlight in a dim room, and many of the scenes involve a deep, subterranean cavern -- which you\\'d then expect to be poorly lit, but had lights coming from all sorts of random angles. Don\\'t ask me why.<br /><br />The plot was pretty bad. Some films can take the idea of military men chasing a terrorist and make a convincing film out of it. Cat and mouse stories are riveting. Well, not here. The terrorist is really not even part of the story, just an excuse to go to the island. And the raptors? And the allosaurus? Sure, they came from the plutonium that soaked into the ground. But if that makes sense to you, please explain it to me because I have no clue how radiation brings dinosaurs back from millions of years of extinction.<br /><br />By far the worst part of \\\\\"Raptor Island\\\\\" is the animation of the raptors. That\\'s right -- the selling point of the film is the worst aspect. The animation isn\\'t just bad, it\\'s subpar. I can\\'t even express the hilarity of cartoons this cheesy. And when they get shot? Red splats like one would see in an old video game. Even the airplane, helicopter and Navy ship are cartoons... how hard is it to get a model plane? Please don\\'t see \\\\\"Raptor Island\\\\\" unless you need a good laugh or want to get sickeningly drunk. Sure, you probably want to see it before you see \\\\\"Raptor Island 2\\\\\" (which seems to be getting better reviews). But just avoiding it entirely is your best bet. The closest thing I can compare it to is \\\\\"Pinata: Survival Island\\\\\", and unfortunately this film makes the pinata look good by comparison. You have been warned.\"'],\n",

However, you may be hard pressed to see anything other than a superficial similarity between them here.<br /><br />Although nicely acted and crafted, \\'Le Boucher\\' has a curious sense of disengagement that will either fascinate or frustrate viewers. While not necessarily a bad thing in itself, this can also give the impression of a lack of depth. It\\'s hard to fully discern what the character motivations are so, depending on your proclivity, you are likely to become either enthralled or disinterested in what they might actually be.<br /><br />Viewers familiar with Francois Truffaut will notice some similarities in approach but Chabrol lacks the concise poetry of that other French great. Even though the opening wedding sequence nicely sets up a scene of normality for the events that follow, it\\'s rather overlong and a more Hitchcockian terseness would certainly have helped. <br /><br />Still, the film does have a strange charm and there are some excellent character ideas regarding the schoolteacher (content with her celibacy long after a bad relationship) being seduced? threatened? by the promise of new love from the local butcher - who may or may not be a murderer. These threads are either unexplored or deliberately withheld, depending on your point of view.<br /><br />A worthwhile watch for those interested but, possibly, not quite the masterpiece some might lead you to believe it is.\"'],\n",

I thought that was beautiful because even though Rosie was the maid, her and Aurora were like family and when Aurora was carrying Rosie in the rain to take her home for the final moments of her life, that was truly beautiful.<br /><br />The story lines with Jerry (Bill Paxton) and Patsy (Miranda Richardson) is just purely for entertainment and laughter, i especially like the airplane fight, people are mixed reviewed on that fight but i laughed so hard.<br /><br />But the emotion of the film, like Aurora making the photo albums, her spreading Rosie\\'s ashes on the beach (my favorite), Jack Nicholson also makes a nice appearance, and finally Aurora\\'s death. All of these elements make for a great movie and succeed.<br /><br />People who write bad reviews or even mixed reviews, probably don\\'t understand the story good enough. This sequel was really not meant to be an exact copy of what the original was 13 years before this, which is why i think people looked at it differently. This is also why it went under a different name, because it was the same characters but a completely different plot and story.<br /><br />Overall, a movie that should be given more credit because it is just as good as the original.\"'],\n",

I have always found that although his films are impressive visually, the dialog and acting is purely secondary at best. However, the acting here is a little better than usual for DeMille--Raymond Massey, John Wayne and Ray Milland are all fine. The only acting that really seemed poor was that of Paulette Goddard, but this isn\\'t surprising because histrionic and over-the-top performances of leading ladies is a DeMille trademark (see Anne Baxter\\'s performance in The Ten Commandments if you don\\'t believe me).<br /><br />Generally, this movie had a well-written plot and it was both unusual and compelling. So because of a decent plot and better than expected acting, this is already a pretty good DeMille film.<br /><br />However, when it comes to the action, some things leave a bit to be desired. While to today\\'s audiences the ship scenes will no doubt look pretty fake, for 1942 they were pretty good AND you could not see the sides of the pool in the underwater shots (something all too common in underwater scenes of the day). So, my BIG argument about the movie visually is the terrible action scene at the end involving the most fake-looking giant squid ever seen on film. I can\\'t imagine, even in 1942, that people would have seen and believed this segment at all. In fact, I would think they probably would have laughed themselves silly! So, the overall product is a mixed bag. It is definitely entertaining, reasonably well-acted (apart from some histrionics here and there) and has fair special effect.

While the premise of the story appears to be warm coming of age of a young girl with only a single mother to guide her growth, the film fragments with so many subplots that are quickly and incautiously pasted together in the end, resolving everything in a shallow overly sentimental and unsatisfying mess.<br /><br />Marlboro, NY 1947, a time when the country is recovering from WW II, which includes the families of GIs killed in the war and the economy in ruins. Harriet (Penelope Ann Miller) keeps together her household of two children - Carrie (Ashley Rose Orr) and Brian (Harrison Chad) - by being a seamstress to the likes of Mrs. Gortimer (Jane Alexander), a town gossip and matchmaker who is advising Harriet to pay attention to the return of Bernard (David Alan Rasche) as a potential \\'marrying kind\\'. Harriet spends her days working and remembering her GI husband killed in the war. Daughter Carrie is approaching puberty and yet refuses to behave like a girl, wearing her father\\'s dogtags and jeans, running instead with a group of boys including her younger brother and two other lads. The \\'gang\\' has a secret clubhouse, make mischief, taunt the mentally challenged neighbor Charlie (Kevin Anderson), unfortunate son of Grizzle (Leo Burmester) who abuses his unwanted son by forcing him to live in a barn. Charlie\\'s only friends are the puppies he treasures. The destructive pranks played on pathetic Charlie include stealing one of his pups, destroying the food garden of Grizzle, pouring sugar in the gas tank of Grizzle\\'s John Deere tractor, etc. In other words this little group of kids is cruel and their shenanigans are mean-spirited.<br /><br />Harriet finds it impossible to control the behavior of Carrie and quite out of keeping with the 1940s family unit, Carrie sasses her mother viciously and in general is an unlikable brat. When Bernard begins his courtship of Harriet the prospect of Harriet\\'s finding a modicum of happiness is undermined by Carrie\\'s behavior. In a particularly cruel evening\\'s prank, Grizzle\\'s garden is destroyed, Charlie is reduced to self-mutilation because of the stealing of his pup, and the lowly barn in which he lives is destroyed by fire. Grizzle and Charlie survive and the effect of this final disaster on the lives of Harriet and her children and their \\'emotional awakening\\' serves to make a hanky call and end the story with an unsatisfying bump.<br /><br />The script by Christopher Fay is pedestrian, leaving the film with poorly motivated characters about whom it is difficult to care. Penelope Ann Miller tries her best to make the most out of Harriet, but Ashley Rose Orr renders one of the least likable young girls on film. This is a black and white script without motivation. Jace Alexander directs, which probably explains why his mother Jane Alexander consented to do the tiny walk-on part to give the film attention. The crew manages to make the mood of America in the post-war years plausible, but the dialogue assigned to the characters undermines those attempts.

Fields in all of his pompous, vulgar glory: evasive, duplicitous, sneaky - utterly wonderful. Delivering dialogue in his unique buzz saw rasp, he gives out so many familiar lines that at times he almost seems to be performing a self-parody. This film brilliantly shows why Fields needed the sound cinema to let him be fully appreciated, and with Paramount giving him free rein to develop his material as he wished, it is not surprising that the film is a classic. Fans need look no further to find the essential Fields.<br /><br />The romance between Judith Allen & Joe Morrison is a rather dull affair, although the young man sings well. Tammany Young plays Fields\\' loyal amanuensis. Movie mavens will recognize comedian Billy Bletcher as the tomato thrower & sour-visaged sheriff Clarence Wilson, both uncredited. Legend has it that Hollywood\\'s first movie star, Florence Lawrence, derelict & forgotten, made one of her last unbilled appearances here before her 1938 suicide.<br /><br />Fields found it useful to populate his films with at least one she-dragon, a female of frightful aspect against whom he could bounce off some of his best humor. This film has two: rail-thin, Nora Cecil - prim & dour as the troupe\\'s suspicious landlady; and most especially silly Jan Duggan, horridly bejeweled & curled, as Field\\'s wealthy target. Here was an actress, now nearly forgotten, who could easily equal in hilarity even Fields himself. It is generally overlooked how important her contribution is to the celebrated supper table scene with Fields & Baby LeRoy - one of the funniest sequences ever to appear in an American film. And her rendition of `Gathering Up The Shells On The Seashore\\' is a wonderful spoof of such sentimental songs as `When You And I Were Young, Maggie,\\' which were so popular in that era. Miss Duggan would return to briefly plague Fields in three additional films, including THE BANK DICK (1940). (She died in 1977 at the age of 95.)<br /><br />Fields has included the old melodrama The Drunkard into the plot and to his credit he plays it \\x91straight,\\' letting its honest antique sentiment speak for itself. In his own private olio, Fields makes a curtain call to show off his astonishing talent of legerdemain. It is wonderful to have his routine captured on film as he really is quite amazing - it is easy to see how at one time he was considered the world\\'s greatest juggler.

From the beginning on it isn\\'t clear which approach the movie picks and what the movie is all about. Really no thriller elements in the first halve, just some formulaic drama and romance. Only halve way through the movie the movie starts to become interesting when the thriller elements of the movie start to appear in to the story. The movie is more thriller than it\\'s film-noir really, which might be a surprising thing, considering the time the year was made in.

The movie has some good genre moments, which mostly works out due to the fine cast and suitable atmosphere of the movie.<br /><br />How often do we get to see Humphrey Bogart in the role of a psycho really?

It\\'s an above average movie due to how professionally it\\'s made and how well the actors handle the script and its more silly (clichés) and unbelievable moments. <br /><br />Perfectly watchable movie, especially for the Bogart fans, who want to see him in a role that is different.<br /><br />7/10\"'],\n",

       "  '\"Purple Plain is an obscure film in Peck\\'s long list of movie credits. I don\\'t know if this British production got much publicity or release stateside, despite Peck\\'s movie star celebrity. Unfortunately, it\\'s never been a TV regular, which is too bad because this tale of renewal and survival is an unusual and gripping one, in spite of the obscurity.<br /><br />The film opens in the Burmese jungle during WWII. Peck is a battle fatigued flyer on the ragged edge of breakdown. He\\'s about to be relieved because of erratic behavior, all the while he\\'s flashing back on his wife\\'s death in a London air-raid. These are well-done scenes causing us to sympathize with his loss. Nonetheless, he\\'s jeopardizing his comrades with reckless manuevers because the loss has undermined his will-to-live. Thus, we\\'re torn between sympathy and concern, just like the flight station doctor (Bernard Lee).<br /><br />In an interesting move, Lee overcomes Peck\\'s agonies by reconnecting him socially, in this case with a nearby missionary community. There Peck finds the vital human relationships so importantly missing from his death-dealing combat duties. As a result, his life takes on new meaning and purpose as a result of rejoining a human community where such life-giving affirmations can emerge. On the whole these are well-done scenes, especially the chaos from the Japanese air attack. In the midst of the carnage, Peck\\'s combat flyer finds a new role in helping to bandage up survivors. Herein lies the movie\\'s basic message and it\\'s an important and humane one, conveyed in fairly subtle fashion, though the turn-around occurs more quickly than I would have liked.<br /><br />Nonetheless, it\\'s interesting that the script avoids the usual officially sanctioned head-doctor therapies. Note that Peck is not sent to be counseled by an air force psychiatrist, nor to join a chest-baring therapy group, nor to have his past puzzled together Freudian style. Of course, the happy solution here remains a \\\\\"movie\\\\\" solution where-- as we all know-- anything can be made to magically happen. Still, for a war-movie setting, the simple affirmation that mental health lies through nurturing social relations and not through government sanctioned killing remains no less suggestive because of its movie origins.<br /><br />The remainder of the film amounts to a survival trek through the wilds of southeast Asia. It\\'s a well-filmed and harrowing struggle against a forbidding landscape where the crash survivors must decide between staying put or hiking out against great odds. But most importantly, it\\'s Peck\\'s chance to regain his humanity by facing up to the odds, not just for his own survival, but for his two comrades as well. The movie\\'s final scene could not have been better conceived. Indeed, no words are necessary. On the whole, this is a subtly and well thought out anti-war film, no less effective because it concerns the fate of one man rather than thousands.Too bad that its humane message remains so generally unseen.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"Reviewed by Elliot V. Kotek (from HATCHfest 2007 in Bozeman, Montana)<br /><br />Director: Kirsten Sheridan Starring: Freddie Highmore, Keri Russell, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Jamia Simone Nash, Marian Seldes, Robin Williams.<br /><br />If you\\'ve ever questioned the impact of music on emotion, August Rush is a must-see that will bury any doubt for all time. Featuring Jonathan Rhys Meyers as rock-star Louis and Keri Russell as New York Philharmonic cellist Layla, and starring Finding Neverland\\'s heartbreak kid, Freddie Highmore, Rush delivers an experience that borders on the sublime and somewhat sentimental in a manner that rivals Neverland and would be reminiscent of Titanic if that ship had not sunk. A stirring performance here by Russell will definitely remind end-of-year voters of her work in Waitress and should serve to solidify her chances for an Oscar-nom.<br /><br />The premise: A promising musician (Russell) is impregnated by a brooding but romantic Irishman (Rhys Meyers) in a one-night affair overlooking Washington Square Park that will change the course of their lives. Despite splinters of wooden dialogue and the obvious, yet ultimately satisfying, use of the music of Van Morrison early in the proceedings, the movie moves past both and bowls audiences over with poignant performances and stunning visuals in a first-class production. Layla\\'s protective father falsely informs his daughter that her love-child did not survive birth, and delivers the boy, Evan, to the State, where the influence of all sounds great and small fill the boy with musical ambition and intuition.<br /><br />In addition to the above-the-liners already singled out, Robin Williams wows in a blinding turn as Wizard, a menacing Fagin whose Oliver Twists are young, homeless musical prodigies and whose milk-cart careers he manages in exchange for their daily take and a fancy stage name. Onto the young Evan, he bestows the moniker August Rush (inspired by a passing grocery van). Director Sheridan (Jim\\'s daughter, Kirsten) keeps the reins on her comic Wizard, and Williams seems to subtly straddle the line between sympathetic and psychotic. Also more than merely noteworthy is Jamia Nash, an 11-year-old with some of the best lines of the flick, who boasts a healthy dose of moxie that provides the perfect counterbalance to some of the heavier themes that accompany a film about an orphan searching for parents he isn\\'t sure exist.<br /><br />While the genesis of the film may have started with producer Richard Barton Lewis\\'s vision of his then-newborn son\\'s little digits directing his own symphony in a Santa Monica delivery room, the screening of this film is sure to inspire many more digits to pick up and pick at a six-string just to see what happens. Here\\'s hoping studio support for the film will see screens increase after opening to take advantage of what should be great word of mouth. With screenings set for the upcoming Heartland FIlm Festival (where the film has been branded with a Crystal Heart Award), the Rome Film Festival and elsewhere, this moving tale is sure to find itself a fixture with families worldwide.\"'],\n",

The local sheriff is faced with an angry community leader demanding an end to the matter, or his resignation. Through the combined efforts of the sheriff and a quick witted mechanic, the source of the problem is discovered, a fifty-foot Gila monster who has run out of food, and is now preying upon the local populace,\\\\\" according to the DVD sleeve\\'s synopsis.<br /><br />God\\'s unexplored wilderness (aka Texas), as shown in the film\\'s beginning, includes no sign of food; so, it\\'s only natural to have its \\\\\"Giant Gila Monster\\\\\" leave.

Watch for both hero Don Sullivan (as Chase) and Sheriff Fred Graham (as Jeff) to put their legs up together, in the auto-mechanic shop (Compton\\'s Garage).<br /><br />The characterizations are interesting. Sullivan is an older \\\\\"influence\\\\\" on the younger and more rebellious \\\\\"gang\\\\\" of teenagers; and, he has turned from hot-rodder to auto-mechanic. He is supporting his mother and crippled little sister. Sullivan also sings well; although, his choice of material definitely does NOT rock.

But little did they know it would be so unexpectedly successful that it would actually have a cult following from all over the world.<br /><br />The brain child of Rob Grant and Doug Naylor, Red Dwarf is unlike any other comedy.

       "  '\"It\\'s always fun making it to the first screening of a new film on the very day it opens. My film-crazy friends and I habitually did this in our college days. Long years later, the thrill has not worn off. This time, the film I lined up to watch at its first screening in town is \\\\\"Eklavya \\x96 The Royal Bodyguard\\\\\". Vidhu Vinod Chopra, the filmmaker who, in the capacity of either director or producer, gave us \\\\\"Parinda\\\\\", \\\\\"Mission Kashmir\\\\\", \\\\\"Parineeta\\\\\", and the two wonderful Munna Bhai movies, was unveiling his new directorial effort, and I was eager to see what lay in store.<br /><br />\\\\\"Eklavya\\\\\" boasts a huge cast of eminent actors; how their services would be utilized has piqued my curiosity for some time. The glittering line-up features Amitabh Bachchan in the title role, along with Chopra regulars Saif Ali Khan, Sunjay Dutt, the exquisite Vidya Balan, Boman Irani, Parikshat Sahni, Jackie Shroff, Jimmy Sher Gill, Raima Sen, and an elegant cameo by Sharmila Tagore.<br /><br />The film opens with the unmistakable voice of Amitabh Bachchan narrating the legend of Eklavya from the Hindu epic, the Mahabharata. Eklavya, a child of undistinguished antecedents yearns to study archery under the tutelage of Dronacharya, the instructor of kings. Contemptuous of his low birth, Dronacharya refuses to accept Eklavya as a student. Undeterred, Eklavya builds a clay effigy of Dronacharya and ceaselessly practices archery before it. Soon after, Dronacharya is taken aback by Eklavya\\'s proficiency, which has outstripped that of his princely pupils. As it wouldn\\'t do for this commoner\\'s skills to rival those of the royalty, the crafty Dronacharya demands a \\\\\"dakshina\\\\\" or teacher\\'s fee from Eklavya. Whatever you wish, the devoted lad replies. Your right thumb--that is what I want as my \\\\\"dakshina\\\\\", commands Dronacharya. Without hesitation, Eklavya slices off the thumb, knowing full well it would end his prowess in archery. The story is meant to illustrate the notion of \\\\\"dharma\\\\\" or the fulfillment of one\\'s sacred duty in any circumstance, regardless of cost. Off screen, the child to whom Amitabh recounts the story protests this outcome, and his shrill tones are the voice of reason.<br /><br />Amitabh, like his dutiful namesake Eklavya, is the loyal manservant and bodyguard of a line of minor royalty in Rajasthan. Despite the family\\'s tyrannical ways, he unswervingly stands by them. The film unfolds in the present, but this particular royal family still resides in a fog of past glory, entitlement, and unquestioned power. Their continuing nastiness has made the natives restless, and the worm is about to turn.<br /><br />The Queen Mother\\'s (Sharmila Tagore) deathbed revelation sets the somewhat baroque, overwrought plot in motion. The heir apparent (Saif Ali Khan), who had earlier fled the principality in disgust at the profligate ways of his relatives, is summoned home for her funeral. Before breathing her last, the Queen pens a letter to her son spilling the proverbial beans. This confession causes a domino effect of cross and double cross, intrigue and counter-intrigue.<br /><br />The film has the look and feel of a stately epic, but Vidhu Vinod Chopra is not interested in the luxuriant pace associated with epics. There is a business-like economy in his approach. There is no waxing philosophical about the misdeeds that have brought this family to its present ugly impasse. He appears to say that was then, in the past, there\\'s no time for that; let\\'s simply watch how their karmic debts are collected now. Voice-overs and numerous brisk flashbacks provide just enough expository detail to follow the events unfolding in the present. The pace is breathless, as though generations of past injustices can wait no longer for expiation. Every now and then, there is a moment of stillness, which one wishes would be held a few seconds longer for the mood to be savored. An effective scene on the palace ramparts is reminiscent of the ghostly visitation in \\\\\"Hamlet\\\\\", and the wraith, despite no lines to declaim, has similar impact.<br /><br />Amitabh Bachchan\\'s magisterial performance as a man programmed for blind duty, having to suddenly distinguish between obligation and reason transcends the silliness of the plot. Saif Ali Khan impresses yet again; there is maturity and depth in his performance as the conflicted prince with the populist conscience. Unlike \\\\\"Parineeta\\\\\", Vidya Balan doesn\\'t have a whole lot to do here, but is dignified and graceful in her few scenes as the commoner in love with a prince. Boman Irani, an actor of sweeping range and intelligence, is a hoot with his hissy fits and sloe-eyed ambiguity, while Jackie Shroff and Jimmy Sher Gill, as the wicked uncle and cousin, handle the villainy with lip-smacking gusto. Sunjay Dutt, fresh off his Munnabhai success, is a welcome presence as the investigating police officer with little patience for the anachronisms of fiefdoms and effete royalty. What a pleasure it is to see Sharmila Tagore, who retains her looks and glamor despite the passage of the years.<br /><br />\\\\\"Eklavya\\\\\" displays a most un-Indian efficiency (in film-making terms, at least) and speed (a mere 105 minutes) in telling its tale that had me longing for a little more of some of the characters. It would be interesting to see just how much of the film was left on the editing room floor\\x85perhaps the DVD will have the deleted scenes. Music is used appropriately: there is a lone song, of which only a judicious snatch is used on screen. The cinematography makes full use of the gorgeous Rajasthani terrain, with its pitiless crags and sun-scorched sands. Clearly, Vidhu Vinod Chopra has an eye on international audiences for his film, and glowing endorsements from the likes of Ralph Fiennes enhance his chances. Here\\'s to you, Mr. Chopra, and more power to you.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"Black Robe (1991) <br /><br />Released with poor timing in the aftermath of a similar themed film - Kevin Costner\\'s Dances with Wolves - Black Robe largely got lost in the shuffle. That\\'s a shame, because the film is actually quite remarkable. Not to say that it hasn\\'t had influence on other films however. Black Robe certainly must have had quite an influence on Terrence Malick and his The New World. The title credits are clearly inspired by those in Black Robe, and other aspects are familiar as well.<br /><br />Set in 17th century Quebec, the film follows a young Jesuit priest, Father Lafourgue (Bluteau), referred to as Black Robe by the natives. He travels with a band Algonquins lead by Chomina (Schellenberg). With Father Lafourgue is Daniel, a young Frenchman, who is in love with Chomina\\'s daughter. The young priest soon begins to inspire fears that he is some sort of demon, and many in the band wish to leave him behind, or possibly even kill him and his companion.<br /><br />Their travels meet turmoil among other hostile native tribes, leading not only a struggle between peoples, but a struggle between faiths. Beresford creates a very bleak atmosphere, using the cold Quebec landscape as an intimidating, but still beautiful backdrop. The weather feels cold, the air crisp. It\\'s really quite a beautiful film to look at.<br /><br />Bruce Moore, who wrote the screenplay and the novel it was based on, went to great lengths in research to accurately portray this period in time. Many have praised the film for its accuracies, while a number of others have however complained that it shows natives as savages. I have to disagree. Neither side is shown as total bad guys, nor total good guys. The film gives everyone a fair shake. Both sides have/had their reasons, and both sides committed terrible acts. Certainly, not all Natives were all about peace and love, which is not a slight to them in the least. Their history is a noble one, and they had every right to fear and be hostile in the face of Europeans. That said, I\\'m probably overcompensating for the film, because it really doesn\\'t show Natives as savages at all, especially not the Algonquins. Moore claimed, in fact, that he actually toned down the violence of the Natives compared to what he found in his research. That said, what he found in his research was most likely overstated to begin with.<br /><br />Black Robe certainly is a bleak picture. The naturalistic photography and tone adds to the depressed atmosphere. This is not a story of joys, but of sorrows. When the film ends, we are told what history has already told us - the Natives were slaughtered and the Jesuit\\'s mission by and large was a futile failure.<br /><br />Though the film sticks to its own dark history, this is more than just a very well done history lesson. Black Robe is a parable of the horrifying results that come from misunderstanding, miscommunication, and ignorance. While the Jesuit mission was well intentioned, it was more a product of Eurocentric ignorance than anything else. The Native people had their own religious beliefs, and the film shows that. The lessons in Black Robe are transferable to any number of modern day conflicts. We have not learned our lesson, and by removing the gloss and glamour off the period epics of old, Black Robe serves as a reminder. Such a shame its so overlooked.\"'],\n",

The rest of this so called neurotic romance is far too inconsequential to bother detailing here.<br /><br />Annie Hall is played by Diane Keaton, an actress who is actually very competent. Her movies are frequently not my favorite, though I did enjoy the cute Baby Boom. Her only memorable aspect in this film is her Ralph Lauren clothes, now of course quite dated, which supposedly caused a fashion revolution at the time. <br /><br />That classic comment of Woody\\'s regarding sex, \\\\\"This is the most fun I\\'ve had without laughing\\\\\" doesn\\'t particularly impress me with its brilliance. Fear not, Shakespeare, Woody serves as no threat to you as master of the English language. It is indeed sad that so many people seem to praise this mindless, uninspiring, unoriginal, and not even particularly amusing pearl of wisdom as though it had virtually descended from the gods on Mount Olympus.<br /><br />Annie Hall isn\\'t the absolute worst movie I\\'ve ever seen, but it really doesn\\'t have much to recommend it. I normally adore romances, but neither one of these two selfish neurotics captured my sympathy or even remote interest. Furthermore, the supposed witty banter between the pair failed woefully to either entertain or amuse me. Back in 1977 when I saw this movie at the theatre with my husband (then boyfriend), we both sincerely wished we\\'d found some paint and watched it dry instead. I guess this intellectual comedy was just far too complicated for little old us to appreciate.\"'],\n",

Well, imagine if that guy was a poodle-sized sewer rat.<br /><br />I wondered going into this movie why Peter Weller would agree to star in what is essentially the rat-equivalent of Jaws: The Revenge. I got my answer about twenty seconds into the film, where it opens on a shot of Shannon Tweed, playing Weller\\'s wife here, showering. Umm, okay.<br /><br />She leaves, along with Weller\\'s extremely dimwitted kid to stay at a hotel (only to pop up later in the movie scantily-clad back in her hotel or in a dream sequence in order to meet some strange 80s boob quota I suppose).<br /><br />Weller is doing fine by himself, (staying behind to finish some work), until the dishwasher overflows, eventually upsetting a rat who decides to move into his apartment. Its hard to gauge just how big this thing is supposed to be until it decides to crawl up under the covers in Weller\\'s bed later, apparently he\\'s the size of a tomcat.<br /><br />Weller does his best to get rid of the rat, upgrading from normal rat traps to (what are basically) miniature bear traps. When the medieval rat traps don\\'t work or come back gnawed on he decides to get a cat, which also comes back gnawed on (or replaced with a cheap stuffed animal that resembles his cat). When he decides to ignore the rat he chews on on his surge protector, fuse box, and therein cutting off the power.<br /><br />Weller runs around the house, bashing holes into walls in search of the rat, is plagued by nightmares of birthday parties where the giant rat jumps out of a sheet cake (?), and where his dimwitted kid ends up mixing in various rat poisons in with his cereal. The finale brought to mind Arachnophobia as it ended in a dank basement; the film ending maybe twelve seconds after the rat\\'s been dispatched as Weller brushes himself off as if the last two hours hadn\\'t just happened just in time to greet his wife and kid at the front door.

What people also have to remember is that, unlike the Jackson renditions, this and \\'The Hobbit\\' were made especially for children. The characters designs and the story itself have to be toned down so that children (or stoners) can follow the story without becoming too freaked out by orcs.<br /><br />Roddy McDowall is pretty much the most hilarious sounding Samwise ever, and the character design fits him perfectly, and both elements create a character of great vulnerability.

I figured that if Fruit Chan was notorious enough to be included in an anthology with those two directors, his contribution would more than hold its own.<br /><br />Well...the results were worth seeing once. \\\\\"Dumplings\\\\\" was both the most revolting and the most socially savvy of the stories; \\\\\"Box\\\\\" displayed the deepest emotions in a tale of loneliness and despair disguised as a ghost story; and \\\\\"Cut\\\\\" was the most overtly gruesome and had the most gimmicky and contrived plot.<br /><br />Since I am unfamiliar with Chan\\'s work, I can\\'t say whether he stretched himself or tried anything new, but I do think that the acting and direction here were the most subtle and complex in the trilogy. Park\\'s stuff seemed very much of a piece with his previous tales of violence and Hitchcockian entrapment that drive the protagonist to despair. But Miike surprised me, since \\\\\"Box\\\\\" was entirely different in tone and structure from his famous film \\\\\"Ichi\\\\\", and I wasn\\'t expecting anything like this from him. \\\\\"Box\\\\\" is more of a waking dream such as Lynch would do in \\\\\"Lost Highway\\\\\" or \\\\\"Mulholland Drive\\\\\" and I thought some of the dialog and photography were most impressive.

It is about a reformed ex-convict, well played by Gene Nelson, being pressured by some escaped cons to assist them, thus endangering his parole and threatening his wife, ably portrayed by Phyllis Kirk. The film is dominated by the massive six foot five noir star, Sterling Hayden, as a tough homicide cop who chews toothpicks non-stop because his doctors won\\'t let him smoke, and who says things like: \\'You\\'re head\\'s full of mush.\\' It\\'s always good to see Sterling Hayden again, the more times he turns up the better; he\\'s solid, he\\'s menacing, and what is more, he\\'s the real thing. You know he\\'d knock you down and then pick you up again, and besides, he\\'s compulsively watchable. In his eyes there is always that half-mad flicker, and that ain\\'t acting. The film is directed with superb applomb by the highly professional Andre de Toth, lucky spouse of the delicious Veronica Lake, and he never wasted a frame. There are numerous fine touches: Sterling Hayden picks up a murdered cop\\'s hat and puts it in the ambulance beside his corpse, but he does this as as afterthought without calling attention to the gesture. In one scene, a crowd of extras stand on the far side of the street watching a police raid. Toth allows them merely to be glimpsed. Toth does not signal and linger, he moves on, he has the confidence and control not to worry. There is lots of Los Angeles as it was in 1952 in this film (released only in 1954). All those fifties people, all those fifties cars, all those fifties shops. Where have they all gone? This picture has action all the way, Gene Nelson and Phyllis Kirk do not sleep in twin beds, things are brutal and quick, but there is no excess of violence. The film is primarily a psychological tension drama, as all true noir must be. Noir is about doubt, insecurity, pressure, and threats all around you, with betrayal and trust as the key issues. Oh yes, and there\\'s love too, which generally takes place between the bullets rather than between the sheets. (No one in a noir film has time to go to bed without being interrupted by a threatening phone call or someone banging on the door. You grab a kiss as you make a run for it.)\"'],\n",

However, after a bad batch, the group begins to see unearthly visions of demonic apparitions trying to attack them.

Now, onto the film: I think I\\'ve decided on a new title: Clichrooms. It\\'s a nice blend on the two main components of this film: shrooms and clichés. Within the first ten minutes we\\'re given: the typical idiot stoner, the nice girl in love with the \\'bad boy with a heart of gold\\' foreigner, the travel deep in the woods for less-than-moral activity, being stranded due to hitting an animal, the shady forests \\'looking for dinner,\\' etc. (I won\\'t even mention the dozen we get at the end of the film.) It got annoying, but eventually evened out when the plot developed. The acting isn\\'t awful, but not very good. . . just enough to make the film watchable. The backstory of the home for delinquents (or whatever the wannabe-Irish guy was talking about) was interesting, and I\\'m glad it was utilized a bit. The writing was quite off, however, resulting in stiff and boring dialogue and poor structure (and, eventually, a bit of a cheap ending). Breathnach\\'s direction and Nanu Segal\\'s cinematography weren\\'t bad and worked well for the film, although the \\'trip\\' visuals got a little too \\'MTV\\' in their editing. Gore is almost nonexistent, or cut away too quickly. Dario Marianelli, an amazing composer, is one positive on this film. The music is very good, and it surprised me when I first heard it, and surprised me even more when I saw the composer. The blur of reality and fiction is actually effective, as it did make the film more than just a typical \\'in the woods\\' slasher.

Through her father, the Duke of Kent, young Victoria was the heir to the British monarchy to which she ascended in 1837.<br /><br />Royalty made its last gasp for power immediately preceding the events that are shown in this mini-series. King William IV played here by Peter Ustinov by royal prerogative dismissed the government of Prime Minster Earl Grey. Robert Peel formed a Tory government, but it only lasted for a few months because Parliament by now had firm control of the Treasury. William IV was forced to call back Earl Grey and bow to the wishes of the people\\'s representatives, now even more representative since the Reform Act of 1832 reapportioned Parliament after several hundred years.<br /><br />So the monarchy was to reign instead of rule, but if this bunch didn\\'t keep a lid on the peccadilloes, the folks in the United Kingdom might just take it in their heads to be rid of them and get themselves a republic like their former colonies had done. That was the duty that Prince Albert (Jonathan Firth) saw it and he persuaded his young bride, Queen Victoria (Victoria Hamilton) that they must do the same.<br /><br />Albert was a serious young man and Victoria had been leading a sheltered life courtesy of her mother Penelope Wilton had led a life away from the dissolute Hanoverian Court of Uncles George IV and William IV. <br /><br />When you have no other purpose in life, but to set an example, you\\'d better be good at that.

Told in a surreal mindset with objects and even animals that somehow come into scene, it is one of those pictures that has many meanings in one. For example, Bunuel directs a sequence in which a young girl, whom her parents are searching for and has been thought to have been kidnapped, is actually right in front of the parents. It makes absolutely no sense, but that is what is so striking about this scene as well as many in that, the girl, who is right in front of their eyes speaking with them, can\\'t be found, thus sending these parents to act on their toes to try and find her. <br /><br />The film regards itself on random episodes that somehow have no connection with each other what so ever. From one scene to the next, the stories are never quite fully developed until the end, kind of like a soap opera. It is one of those types of pictures in which many different characters, with their own dilemmas, are left till the next time around to pick up where they left off in their sequence. The main quest for Bunuel is to question the morality of the characters. Why is it that society considers the idea of going to the restroom as something that has to be done in private. Who created these rules? Who created the rules that man has to be clothed in public, but can do whatever he pleases in private? Is this a moral question as to what is moral or not moral to do, or is this something that society has created as something moral? Bunuel leaves that up to his viewer to identity and question. Shot in a similar fashion as many of the Monty Python pictures, Bunuel\\'s film is definitely more subtle, yet adventurous and hilarious at all means. It shows how surrealism doesn\\'t always have to be dramatic, and he strays away from his start in drama, but achieves a perfect wisdom and understanding through it.\"'],\n",

It accomplished so much through such simplicity. Everything was top notch from the elegant directing to the subtly wonderful performances down to the magical score. The film demands you to feel not only for the death we witness, but for the incredible life we discover. It prays on the obvious morality issues we all deal with but also dangles the idea in front of us that everyone goes through the same joys and grievances, just not in the same way. This is a momentous tale that deserves nothing less than the title of brilliance. <br /><br />This visually and emotionally rich movie recalls the life of a very peculiar man born in the early 20th century who ages backwards. His tale unfolds through a diary read by the daughter of his love, Daisy. Throughout life he goes through the same things we do, growing up and eventually growing old. He\\'s a thoughtful observer, discovering life from all different angles. But it is not his life that makes him unique. His love is what makes him special. He spends a lifetime trying to understand how his love for Daisy works and still only gets a few incredible years really loving her. As their lives tell us, the years of frustration and hardship are all worth it if only for a few moments of happiness. <br /><br />The direction in the film is almost flawless. Hopefully, Benjamin Button will garner David Fincher the recognition he deserves. He winds this clock so well and with such grace that the movie has this undeniable flow that is enjoyable from start to finish. At nearly 3 hours, there is not a minute wasted. Every shot is jaw dropping and while some will find issue with the time, it is used wisely. <br /><br />The acting is also a thing of wonder. This is by far Brad Pitt\\'s best performance. He is so believable and realistic throughout. His nuances are spot on and despite the heavy use of make-up and CGI used to portray his character, it is Pitt who makes Benjamin that much more curious. <br /><br />I left the theater astonished that some one could review this movie badly. It is an extremely graceful depiction of life, love, and the things we lose. After so much anticipation I was certainly not disappointed. This movie is probably not for everyone though. It\\'s not your average drama that spoon feeds it\\'s audience their emotions. It is something of awe and astonishment, an absolute gem.

       "  '\"I first saw this film back in 1976, and only remembered that it was fiercely arousing to a young man at the time. I didn\\'t catch the story, however. Times have changed since then, and I recently viewed the film a couple of times, when I wrote subtitles to it so I could show it to a close friend.<br /><br />Emmanuelle falls between X-rated and art-house. If one views it as an adult film, then the lack of male frontal nudity and full-on intercourse make the film feel timid. OTOH, for an art film, the plot is quite thin.<br /><br />When the film premiered in the mid \\'70s, it made a stir. Most of the brouhaha was about it being shown in regular theaters instead of seedy back-alley ones. Today we see so much erotics and sex in regular films and on TV that such discussions would seem ridiculous.<br /><br />Emmanuelle is based on the autobiographical novel with the same name, by Emmanuelle Arsan. The book (1971) was banned in France, ostensibly for too much erotic content, but the Foreign Department may have influenced this, since the story gives a decadent impression of them.<br /><br />Young and innocent Emmanuelle travels to Bangkok to her newly-wed husband, ten years her senior. He lives in a setting where bored Embassy wives resort to promiscuity and intrigue to fend off a sense of boredom and lack of purpose in life. Her husband clearly feels at home in this setting.<br /><br />Both her husband and the wives tell Emmanuelle to \\\\\"get free of inhibitions\\\\\", which they themselves clearly have done. The film is essentially her journey towards that goal. Her husband has others help him in \\\\\"her education\\\\\".<br /><br />At first viewing the film is admittedly just an erotic flick, with thin connections between the erotic scenes. But after a few more times it becomes clear that director Jaeckin and screen writer Richard really tried to follow the book, and the characters and their actions seemed plausible and natural.<br /><br />Perhaps the most surprising thing about this film is, it does not seem old, like many other European erotic films of the time.<br /><br />One can also view this film as a discourse between the male and female aspects of sensuality. There is the male dream of sex and eroticism without emotional commitment, and promiscuous relations with beautiful, willing girls and women. And the (possibly today somewhat outdated?) female sexuality as sensuality, commitment and pure love, with its slow love making and longing for true companionship.<br /><br />Emmanuelle can also be seen as a spiritual road movie, where she starts off as an innocent, yet strongly sensual girl, who slowly reaches sexual awareness and competence. From sex drive as the master to her as the master and erotics as just another tool in her chest.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend this film especially for grown-ups who have seen enough porn, or love scenes in regular films, and who want to remember instead what erotic meant. There still aren\\'t that many films in this niche between porn and mainstream.\"'],\n",

Mankiewicz\\'s Somewhere in the Night (1946). And she does well too. Extremely well by a rather difficult role. Is she a good girl, or one of the villains? Nancy plays it cool, which is a perfect choice, especially when surrounded by consummate scene-stealers like Richard Conte, Lloyd Nolan, John Hodiak and Fritz Kortner. But her debut proved to be the high point of her motion picture career. Next cast in a Fox \\\\\"B\\\\\", The Brasher Doubloon (1947) opposite George Montgomery\\'s Philip Marlowe, she followed with a minor Dan Dailey 1948 musical, Give My Regards to Broadway. Fox then dropped her. At this stage, Orson Welles came to her rescue by offering her the part of Marie Antoinette in Black Magic (1949) in which Gregory Ratoff fronted for him as producer and director. (Ratoff actually did direct half the movie, but Welles handled all his own scenes and wrote some of his own dialogue). Although this United Artists release was anything but a success, Universal offered Miss Guild a contract. She played the main feminine role in Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man (1951) and was then third-billed (Mark Stevens and Rhonda Fleming were the stars featured on all the posters) in Little Egypt (1951). Fourth billing in Francis Covers the Big Town (1953) and a minor role in Otto Preminger\\'s 1971 Such Good Friends completed her motion picture career. Eight film roles, only one of which (her first) is of any importance. What a waste! <br /><br />Getting back to the rivetingly noir, Somewhere in the Night, this movie is not just an actor\\'s heyday (which it is \\x96 you\\'ll probably miss the clever way one of the players signals the plot to the audience in the first 15 minutes, so watch for it on a second view), but a photographer\\'s and set designer\\'s paradise as well. Mankiewicz keeps a firm control of both acting and atmosphere. This exceedingly well-produced movie always enjoyed a considerable cult reputation, which, for once, was thoroughly deserved.

He had made many films with them, but wanted to be more independent. In this film, Garfield plays Charley Davis, a lower middle class New Yorker with a talent for boxing. Not unlike many boxers, certainly of that time period, using your fists for sport was a way out of your meager background. While I have never been a big fan of John Garfield and did not consider him a top notch actor of the golden age of Hollywood, this part does seem made for him. Garfield is quite good here, playing the conflicted Charley with skill and credibility. There are actually few real boxing scenes in the film, except for the end, and that is why labeling this as a \\'boxing movie\\' seems a bit deceptive. There are capable supporting players, including the lovely Lili Palmer, who loves Charley. Robert Conrad and Lloyd Gough ably play the tough guy thugs who want Charley to sell his soul for money. A notable performance by African-American actor Canada Lee is striking - considering this is 1947 and is treated as an equal by the white actors. Garfield was known for his politically liberal views, and perhaps this is why he later ended up as an enemy of the Communist witch hunters in Washington. Garfield\\'s untimely death at age 39 was a shock to many - his funeral was mobbed by thousands. Perhaps this elevated his image above the work he left behind in film - but still, this film and a handful of others are quite good.\"'],\n",

The story line of the motivations behind the assassination is built up around the theft a huge quantity of the gold that the National-Socialist government had accumulated that went \\\\\"missing in action\\\\\" so to speak. The film shows a train hi-jack of the gold , though not sure if that happened, but huge quantities of gold did disappear post-war Germany and was never found.<br /><br />Whether this was really the route (and the root) of the motivations behind the events which led to his sudden death is debatable but I am very intrigued as to whether or not the death of Patton as shown here was a reasonable accurate re-creation of that death, something which sadly appears not to worry too many of the previous reviewers. The build-up to the set-up so that his vehicle came round a bend and hit a parked lorry seemed to be well done and just how you would expect an \\\\\"accident\\\\\" to be pre-arranged.<br /><br />Kennedy\\'s portrayal of Patton\\'s aggressive Anti-Soviet, anti-communism, with the post-war Red Army command\\'s behaviour having no difficulty coming right down to meet the low expectations Patton had of them seemed well done. <br /><br />Patton had many enemies in the US. One of the things that he did to infuriate those who wanted to use the Allied victory to unleash a vindictive payback over and against the defeated enemy was to release the Post-War POW\\'s under his jurisdiction, the only set of Post-war POW\\'s to be set free during that time to go back home instead of suffering and dying of starvation and disease in unsheltered open fields surrounded by barbed-wire and shot at by guards as was the fate of others German solders in these post-war death camps. <br /><br />These Germans were to be made to pay time and again for their collective sin, with a usurious rate of interest, so that punishment and retribution was to be their fate. Patton wasn\\'t interested in such policies once the victory had been won but his internal enemies were. <br /><br />He was recalled to the US and was due to go home imminently and had already been stripped of his executive powers but Patton\\'s enemies could well have thought that they needed to get their pay-back time in quickly before he did get back to the US and start to interfere with their plans against post-war Germany because of his high-status in the US despite their incessant campaigns to undermine his credibility.<br /><br />So an uneven film methinks with some good parts and some bad but the slices of good parts giving food for thought about the great man\\'s demise.\"'],\n",

So much lame drivel masquerading as dialogue, with an occasional \\\\\"hip\\\\\" quip -- about Meat Loaf or Anne Heche -- that stands out like a sixth finger on a hand it\\'s so clumsy.<br /><br />The actors, no matter how cute, are at sea with this poor a script. Scott Lunsford is a total cypher in the impossible role of a deeply passive straight guy who pretends to be gay so he can romance a screechy straight woman. She\\'s Emily Hands, and you haven\\'t seen this raspy a performance since Elizabeth Berkley in Showgirls. Ryan Carnes is way cute as a gay stud, but has little presence. He and Lunsford share the silliest, most embarrassing nude scene in recent history. After some (poorly shot and choreographed) oral sex, the director actually shoots them pulling up their pants so we can see their weenies! A new low of sorts. And yes that Jim guy from American Idol is the gay geek. His character is the closest to a real person, but he\\'s no actor.<br /><br />This is the worst gay comedy I\\'ve seen since All Over the Guy. If you flipped for the West Hollywood drivel, run out and rent this. Otherwise, stick with Trick or Passing Glances, real movies about real gay people.<br /><br />I only go on so long because I am AMAZED at all the good reviews this film has received. Does the director have hundreds of dear friends, or have gay people lost their common sense and good taste?\"'],\n",

Like a blood spattered, low-budget Orson Welles of 70\\'s exploitation, the immensity of his debut will forever haunt him and his career.<br /><br />The task of committing TCM to words is a difficult one, not because the proper words don\\'t exist but merely because they can only describe the surface and never convey the essence and the heart and what can only be felt in one\\'s own skin and maybe that of others. Sounds of animals and howling of beasts and the clanking of rustling metal speak TCM\\'s language. The dissonant chord that sounds in the soundtrack as the movie fades from black to flashes of decaying flesh is TCM\\'s lingo and what defines it is disorientation.<br /><br />Indeed the first shot proper that opens the movie, that of a rotten head and as the camera zooms out we see the whole dead body in a grotuesque posture like some sort of zombified jester sitting atop a gravestone, offers no clue and safe grip for the viewer. After the opening credits roll, we are served an orange sun burning in a blackened sky and that dissolves into the image of a dead armadillo laying on the street. We\\'re 5 minutes into the movie and we\\'re provided no clues of typical genre orientation, no protagonists of any sort. As the eye scans the image for something to cling to, narrative or otherwise, there\\'s nothing there save for decay and death.<br /><br />And then TCM starts rolling and picks up steam and never stops. Apart from how original or not the concept is (crazed backwoods family terrorizing city kids) it\\'s the approach that makes all the difference. Hooper achieves sensory terror and doom by piling on images and sounds, each of them spilling to the next frame starting an avalanche of horror. A close shot of cattles as the van drives in the background, a seedy gas station, a crazed hitch-hiker the kids pick up, an abandoned house. In the interior shots of the abandoned house the blacks are crushed and we only see silhouettes moving against the textures in the walls and those are juxtaposed with exterior shots where the whites wash out, like some kind of rural hell, a land of some other order that is coming apart under the weight of its own abandonment.<br /><br />Even when the sensory chaos is broken for a while so that our genre expectations can be fulfilled as the crippled guy Franklin mutters to a couple that leaves the abandoned house to make out \\\\\"Yeah, see you in an hour or so\\\\\" (followed by a drone in the score) and we just know he\\'s never gonna see them again, a typically ominous foreshadowing common in slashers, that only lasts for seconds. Then Hooper cuts back to puzzling images, feathers on the ground and some kind of dreamcatcher made of bone (?) and weird buzzing sounds in the score, like otherwordly insects flying unseen. TCM constantly tips its own axis, content to be left out of balance.<br /><br />The first encounter with notorious chainsaw-wielding Leatherface is as disorienting as anything that comes before it. He appears out of nowhere like a beast in a frenzy and the carnage begins. And for a movie of TCM\\'s reputation there is surprisingly no (or at least little) explicit gore. Yet the violence is startling and raw as the images that preceed its outburst spill into it and add their own touch of the morbid. Eisenstein must have been clairvoyant when he spoke of how powerful montage can be.<br /><br />We\\'re also given glimpses to Leatherface\\'s tortured, crazed soul, bits of characterization like a gesture and a look of his eyes. Not a psycho killer out of sadistic pleasure perhaps, he looks more like a savage beast defending its territory or a wild dog scared of intruders trespassing in his nest.<br /><br />Like an avalanche of macabre images that is impossible to stop once it starts, TCM whizzes by in a manic pace. The chase scene where Leatherface hunts down Marilyn Burns, scared out of her wits and howling like a wounded animal, is shot through branches of trees, as if the landscape is conspiring to ensnare the victim and so hunter and hunted run in the fields and inside a house and then back outside while the titular chainsaw is buzzing away in a constant reminder of gruesome death. Even when Hooper overplays his hand (as in the dinner scene) it\\'s all done with deliberation that cannot be ignored, like maybe the director is as insane as the characters he\\'s depicting and he takes great pleasure in basking in their insanity.<br /><br />TCM simply has to be experienced, no critical analysis can do it justice. Without bucketloads of gore, without the slick look of high budget, it remains one of the most bleak, atmospheric and aurally violent movies of all time. What happened to Tobe Hooper\\'s career after it is anyone\\'s guess, but TCM is good enough to top entire filmographies of other directors. It has been imitated countless times, remade and given sequels and prequels to, but there\\'s something primeval about the original that can\\'t be recaptured.\"'],\n",

Every year around Christmas SVT has a new \\\\\"big\\\\\" production to show, and every year it feels at least a little bit disappointing. And as far as these go, \\\\\"Snapphanar\\\\\" has to be one of the worst in recent years.<br /><br />What shocks me most about this production is undoubtedly the incredibly low level of ambition. It\\'s always easier for me to forgive a movie when it aims for the stars and fail. \\\\\"Snapphanar\\\\\" barely aims for the tree-line it seems, and still it disappoints. Maybe it\\'s a sign of extremely low self-esteem in Swedish public-service?<br /><br />The strange thing is that on the surface this production is not that bad. The visuals are pretty good, the production values are not bad for a (in international perspective) low-budget production. But under the cracks in the surface you can see how shallow it is. Here we see the low ambition that i mentioned earlier. Historical facts are fabricated, changed or just simply ignored. And the script seems to be written by a ten-year-old. The plot is simplistic, the \\\\\"twists\\\\\" can be seen a mile away and the story itself is uninteresting and bland. As a theme the story about \\\\\"Snapphanar\\\\\" could be interesting. It\\'s (as far as i know) a rather unique thing in Swedish history. A partisan group wanting to make the shire \\\\\"Skåne\\\\\" part of Denmark instead of Sweden, fighting armed battle for their cause. But the whole premise is squandered here by poor writing and non-existent regard for historical facts. Also the fact that these partisan rebels seem to be a gang completely inane idiots doesn\\'t help. They are portrayed like a bunch of stumbling do-gooders completely without fighting skill, making it very clear why Skåne is still Swedish today.<br /><br />Well, how about entertainment value? Sometimes a decent entertainment value on the surface can save even the most shallow movie. Not in this case though i\\'m afraid. There are just too many things to be annoyed about even if you don\\'t think to closely about what you\\'re watching. The incomprehensible accents (sounding like the Skåne-dialect mixed with Danish and a tinge of retardation), the \\\\\"Le Pacte des loups\\\\\"-inspired fighting scenes that lack energy, and the names and dialog that makes you laugh at the most inappropriate moments. Directors Mårlind and Stein have a distinctive Hollywood-complex that also shines through in a disturbing way.<br /><br />I don\\'t know how much \\\\\"Snapphanar\\\\\" cost to produce. It looks more expensive than most standard Swedish TV-fare but since it was made in Estonia it was probably quite cheap. No matter though since this was definitely a case of very little bang for your buck. I just wonder when Swedish TV and film-makers will understand that a good and solid script is the base in every good movie. When they understand that and hire someone decent to write the script (instead of burning their money on fight-scenes filmed from three angles), then maybe this could be entertainment rather than just a bland and boring waste of money and time.\"'],\n",

At all.<br /><br />Director Frank doesn\\'t do much to liven the film up, it doesn\\'t have much in the way of style or visual quality & it\\'s very, very dark. The entire film is set in one house & I just have to ask how many times can you have your character\\'s run up & down the stairs before it begins to get tiresome? There are so many things that I didn\\'t like about this film I could go on all day long but I think you get the idea, I don\\'t like Sorority House Massacre at all. Forget about much gore, every person who is killed in this film is dispatched the same way. Everyone is stabbed, there\\'s no variety to the murders & there\\'s a distinct lack of exploitation & blood. There\\'s a bit of nudity but if that\\'s what you want go hire some porn out.<br /><br />Technically Sorority House Massacre actually isn\\'t too bad & could even be described as being quite well made, it\\'s just a shame the film overall sucks so bad. The acting was neither here nor there, average at best.<br /><br />Sorority House Massacer is yet another cheap low budget piece of crap from executive producer Roger Corman\\'s New Concorde Pictures, I sat there openly willing it to finish I was that bored. Total crap & I just about hated every lame boring minute of it, there are loads more much better slasher films out there for anyone to be bothering with such a crap film such as Sorority House Massacre. One to avoid. I\\'m not sure why but a sequel Sorority House Massacre II (1990) turned up a few years later, I\\'ve seen it & yes it\\'s an improvement but not by much.\"'],\n",

This gave it the distinction of being on the theatre screens when the Sunday morning sneak-attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7th.<br /><br />CLEARLY this would mark an abrupt change of direction that the series would be taking as the Fleischer animation operation would join in with the rest of Hollywood in the War Effort. The story lines from hence forth would be as populated with Nazi Soldiers, Imperial Japanese Agents and 5th Column Saboteurs as the were with all of those Mad Scientists.<br /><br />MUCH in the same manner as the other entries into the SUPERMAN Series, there is no wasting of time. The trouble with the giant, metal creatures are in progress of wreaking their brand of havoc on the Good Folks of Metropolis when the Cartoon Short opens. They are in the middle of an in-progress menace. Much of the necessary exposition is put into place by means of headlines in the Daily Planet. (A clever use of the visual medium; as the inclusion of any Title Cards would be considered strictly passé and a throwback to the days of the Silent Movies.) FOR all of the magnificent scientific marvels that were embodied in the invention of the giant metal robots, the Mad Scientist is concerned only in looting bank vaults, pillaging jewelry establishments and repelling attacks from Tommy Gun wielding Uniformed Coppers. Perhaps this is due to poor pay, working conditions and lack of employment opportunities for brilliant, albeit Mad Scientists that they are forced to supplement their meager incomes through such unlawful means.<br /><br />FURTHERMORE no one ever has truly explained just what makes these eggheads so \\'Mad\\', anyhow! ALL kidding aside, the short is fast moving, well plotted and rendered in such a manner as to be an animated equivalent of a museum quality painting from one of the Dutch Masters. (No, Schultz; I didn\\'t mean the Cigars!) \\'MECHANICAL MONSTERS\\' comes complete with all the accoutrements that are needed in a series entry. First of all, the above mentioned renegade scientist is there for starters; along with some spectacular method of exacting the plunder on an otherwise helpless Metropolis. The regular Daily Planet gang gets involved in the natural manner; coming to the danger with hopes of getting \\\\\"a Scoop!\\\\\" MISS LOIS LANE, in order to have a chance to \\\\\"Scoop the other Scoopers\\\\\" gets a little too close and is abducted unwittingly by the baddies; having slipped and fallen into the iron giant\\'s convenient and cavernous trunk space.

SPEAKING of recurring patterns, Superman manages to save the day, saving Miss Lane and her headline story. All\\'s well that ends well, especially in Metropolis; as the episode closes out with a wink from Clark Kent to the audience.<br /><br />WE suppose that we could brand the Superman Cartoons as being formula and even clichéd, but that may not be fair, either; for after all, the Fleischer/Famous Studios\\' productions were essentially blazing new trails in the field of the animated movie. Whereas here to for, virtually all of the animated cartoon out put was done using highly caricatured human characters, anthropomorphic talking animal\\'s characters or both. The idea of writing an action-adventure story featuring realistically rendered human characters in fantastic, albeit serious short subjects hadn\\'t been done before, unless it would be highly obscure.* THE Fleischer SUPERMAN Series changed all of that by paving the way for so many of those adventure cartoons that we have enjoyed over the years on Saturday morn. Like most of the rest of this series, we rate it very high on the scale.<br /><br />NOTE * We can think of Walt Disney\\'s FANTASIA (Walt Disney Productions/RKO Radio PUctures/1940) as being an exception; several of the segments having been done in a realistic style.

       "  '\"This was one of the most dishonest, meaningless, and non-peaceful of the films I have ever seen. The representation of the other, of the Israelis, was racist, backward, and unfair. For one, the song played on E.S\\' car radio when pulled up alongside a very right-wing Israeli driver was \\\\\"I put a spell on you\\\\\" by Natacha Atlas. The song\\'s style is quite Arabic, but it was released on an Israeli compilation CD, and I have even heard it on the radio in Israel. Many Israeli songs (as well as architecture, foods, and slang) are influenced by Arabic culture, and there is no reason an Israeli Jew would be offended or angered by a nearby car playing that song. The way E.S. appears so calm and collected with his sunglasses and cool glare, via a long, still shot, is meant to force the viewer into seeing the Jew as haggard and racist, and E.S. as noble and temperate.<br /><br />I have traveled all over Israel, and I have never seen an IDF recruitment poster, since service is mandatory. But in the film, not only is there a recruitment poster, but it depicts a stereotypical image of an Arab terrorist and the words \\\\\"want to shoot?\\\\\" This is an extremely inaccurate depiction of the mentality of the majority of Israelis as well as Israeli soldiers, and such an \\\\\"advertisement\\\\\" wouldn\\'t even exist on a random Israeli highway. In including it, the director aims to convince the audience that Israel is a society of anti-Arab racists hell-bent on murder.<br /><br />The ninja scene was gratuitous and needlessly violent. A Hollywood-style action scene involving Israeli soldiers shooting Palestinians would be just as unwelcome in an Israeli-directed film as the ninja scene should have been. But for some reason, images of an unrealistic, non-comic, and violent scenario manage to elicit applause from the audience since the director has smeared the Israeli side so much beforehand, that any shot of Israeli soldiers being killed would be welcome. The director shows absolutely no attempt at building bridges, portraying the \\\\\"other\\\\\" as human, or working towards peace; violence is made to be the only solution. This is furthered by scenes of exploding tanks, falling guard towers, and other random acts of destruction. One of my best friends serves in the Israeli military, and the targets in firing ranges are never Arab women dressed in black, or any other quasi-civilian on canvas. Soldiers at checkpoints are instructed not to fire at the head of an approaching Palestinian unless it is clear that their own lives are in danger; the method, according to my friend, is to provide a warning shout, fire into the air or around the area, and then if all else fails, shoot in the leg and then interrogate and hospitalize. Arbitrarily targeting a woman in the head, as shown in the film, is not the proper procedure.<br /><br />Besides these inaccuracies, the directing style was also poor. Repetition became repetitious, and no longer captivating. Symbols, such as the balloon with Arafat drawn on it, are forced outside any plot structure or effective integration in the setting; the balloon is Palestine penetrating and regaining Jerusalem, and it is created for no reason by E.S. The ambulance being checked for permits by Israeli soldiers followed by subsequent Israeli ambulances flying past the checkpoint is an overly-overt claim of an Israeli double standard by the director. The attempt by the director to show life in Nazareth as dreary and pointless is done with overkill; showing the routines of random people over and over again, even with a slight change each time, and emphasizing that not one member of the cast ever smiles and is minimalist in dialogue almost screams out the purpose of such scenes, the dreariness of life, without allowing much room for personal interpretation. By contrasting one \\\\\"section\\\\\" of the movie, daily life in Nazareth, with the second section, the checkpoint between Ramallah and Israel, the director subtly blames this dreariness on Israel, but never provides any direct evidence as to why such blame can be properly argued.<br /><br />I spent hours trying to figure out why music ended abruptly and began abruptly, and why many modern fashion-show-like and metal-action tracks were included in the score. I still cannot come up with an answer. I felt that the music was out of place in this film; the contrast between more silent scenes and intense scenes was actually annoying and not affecting or thought-provoking. I can understand if the director intended for the music to provide some comic aspect to certain scenes, but I found that there was nothing comic to be found in Israeli soldiers shooting at targets or fighting a ninja, or a woman having to suffer another walk through a checkpoint, albeit defiantly. In fact, I was tempted to close my ears during intense scenes, and annoyed by the lack of a score during quiet scenes. Whatever the director\\'s intent, it provided only an audial displeasure throughout the film.<br /><br />This film has no legitimate political message because it provides an inaccurate and extreme representation of the other, and neglects to actually address any issues. It is a propaganda film, because the director intends various symbols, styles, and scenes to draw sympathy for the Palestinian side, while displaying the Israeli side as cruel and inhuman without exception; the vibrant atmosphere of an action-packed Hollywood scene or of intense music is displayed in every act of violence by Palestinians against Israelis, such that the almost inevitably positive and thrilled feelings the music and cinematography elicit from the audience are directed to one side. There is no thought, reflection, or deepening of the understanding of the conflict by the audience; emotions are simply pulled to one side, and kept there, in a \\\\\"good vs bad\\\\\" cliché scenario. I believe this film lacked the depth, quality, and power of other Palestinian films, such as \\\\\"Paradise Now\\\\\" and \\\\\"Wedding in the Galilee.\\\\\"\"'],\n",

In the beginning you see these two guys arguing about nothing.The one guy says BS about 10 times. Its like he wanted your attention or that was his favorite thing to say. And then we see Gary Daniels fight this chunky guy.The camera poorly shows them fight like almost the whole time we only saw a part of their body\\'s plus the camera was sideways and nearly upside-down. There is a lot more of this great camera work in other parts of the film. On the box Gary Daniels has a katana sword,I didn\\'t see him use it in the film,where in the heck was it and according to the box his family is in a house and he wanted to get them out because bad guys were going to blow the home up and after all of the fighting you never saw him get them out or at the end or at any time at all. Daniels talks to this guy who in prison on a filthy bench for 15 plus minutes!What a waste of film and time.Is all the guy was talking about was I gotta stop taking drugs and get out of here.If I wanted to a conversation like that I\\'LL talk to MY next door neighbor. There was so much silly talk,some of the worst camera work and it looks like some one was rubbing the color on the film,oh it was so messed up.It looked like this was a practice feature instead of a movie.I can\\'t even describe how horrible the score and music was. This movie was so dang bad I laughed and laughed and I said I can\\'t believe this,that someone actually made a film like this.What a terrible piece of film,I just can\\'t believe it.Its some of the worst I have seen.Do you believe ME?If not just rent Black Friday and see for yourself.Black Friday is one of best of the worst films ever made! So the bottom line is if you like really bad films this is thing is for you otherwise if want a really big time action flick but I rented Black Friday and gave the film another chance. The results was that it made Me laugh even more! The fight scene between Gary Daniels and co-fight coordinator Tsuyoshi Abe was even funnier in the green lighted car garage. The scene was a slow fight but Daniels delivers with a great kick with a mean look on his face to the sturdom area of Tsuyoshi Abe\\'s character as he hits the wall hard. The conversation on the bench did last almost fifteen minutes! The villain I thought was better than before but he still said BS about six times during the beginning:) The music was very bizarre but yet it grows on you as the films goes on.

But you can\\'t feed on candy only, you know. At the time when I\\'m writing this review, Avatar sits on the 24th position of the TOP250, between 25th Silence of the Lambs and 23th Once Upon a Time in the West. If this won\\'t change, it\\'s quite obvious where the TOP250 on IMDb is going.<br /><br />OK, so why it sucks?<br /><br />Story - Main character, Jake, infiltrates a tribe of aliens on some planet. This tribe resides on the source of some highly expensive mineral. The tribe must be wiped out because of it. Jake starts to like his new friends, because they seem to be cool and in harmony with their nature. He also fell in love with female alien, Nscho-tschi, er... Neytiri. Battle between humans and aliens. The end. -- Well, not only has been this around thousand times over and over again, but it (go figure!) might have taken some bits from the history as well. Dances with Wolves have been mentioned in some reviews and I can think of even more accurate example - Enemy Mine (1985). Wiping the native Americans was a damn shame from any angle, but please, we all have got the point that it was wrong, OK? Get over it and don\\'t breed the hate among the dumb mooing cattle. If you need some movie history lesson from this area, go see the Little Big Man (1970), the plot is exactly the same, only you won\\'t need the 3D goggles.<br /><br />Script - None. The pattern could have been written by anybody, who has seen the standard action flicks. First few minutes, we get the direct explanation about what, where, who and why. And you know this type of explanation, right? Actors talking to each other and explaining the situation, like they never met before. The lecture from Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) given to Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver, why?) in their first dialog raised my palm to my face. The intellect of the audience has been lowered down again. Then standard romantic part with a twist in second part, the main character is obviously the chosen one, because some force says so and of course we have a baddie from the army and the stupid leader who just wants money too. The aliens win the final battle and the lead character becomes one of them. Duh.<br /><br />Actors and setting - Who the hell need actors when we\\'ve got CGI? I was in the theater with my brother, who plays computer games a lot. After we came out of the building, he named me several things, which have been taken out straight from several PC games, like Command and Conquer, Heroes of Might and Magic, Warcraft and so on. So another rip-off. <br /><br />Visual effects - You\\'ve got this right. But wait another 20 years. It\\'s like silicon breast. Now it looks good on your 20 years old body, but wait another 20. I still can\\'t believe the score on IMDb is based solely on visual effects. It\\'s so wrong!<br /><br />I have a theory about the whole thing. I think Cameron has been paid a fortune to do this. Why? Let\\'s say the movie entertainment industry has a problem, that people don\\'t go to theaters anymore, because they can watch movies from home, especially when they can get it on piratebay, right? So the industry needs a new type of movies. Movies with lame story, lame script, lame everything, but top CGI, 3D, IMAX, ultra-mega-realistic screening, so the movie downloaded from the internet is, in fact, useless. I\\'ve got nothing against this strategy. I don\\'t give a damn about these mindless flicks, but they just don\\'t belong among the TOP250, that\\'s why I went to see Avatar. Out of curiosity.

The Other Boleyn Girl is almost PURE FICTION from beginning to end. Why did they bother to tack on SOME accurate historical outcomes (in written sentence form) of the characters at the end, just before the credits rolled? <br /><br />Just to name a couple of examples: Mary Boleyn was married to William Carey as depicted, and Henry took her as his mistress with Carey\\'s approval as he was richly rewarded. Maybe emotionally conflicted approval, I don\\'t know. I rather doubt it. Anyway, in the film Mary marries a commoner at the end. The film never explains what happened to Carey, it would seem to suggest she is committing bigamy! <br /><br />In the closing \\\\\"write-over\\\\\", we read that Mary lived happily ever after with the lower class guy; in fact, her family looked down on her and even rejected her because she brought down their status. She suffered emotionally and financially due to the marriage, but was still glad she finally married for love. <br /><br />Other things that are totally false: Anne and Mary did not hang out all the time as is suggested in the film; I understand that serves the plot well so maybe I will let that one go. Can\\'t let this one go: Henry raping Anne before she surrendered to him. That is ridiculous. And Anne convincing her brother to have incest with her so as to produce an heir? That is even more ridiculous. She would never have broken the incest taboo; also, if Henry was really shunning her bed by that time, as Anne suggests in the film, then if she turned up pregnant she would be accused of adultery and sent to the Tower! <br /><br />Speaking of being sent to the Tower, in real life Anne conducted herself with great dignity and restraint before and at her execution, likely she was trying to protect her daughter Elizabeth and better secure her daughter\\'s future relationship with Henry. She was innocent of adultery but kept her mouth shut when she knew her fate was sealed. This is not at all how Anne is portrayed in the film. <br /><br />Cardinal Wolsey is left out of the movie entirely, and he played a MAJOR role in the whole drama of the divorce from Catherine of Aragon and Henry\\'s desire for Anne Boleyn. <br /><br />I just don\\'t see why this same type of movie could not have been made with FICTIONAL kings and queens and other characters--no authentic names. Then it would not be a particularly good movie but it would be less aggravating. Of course, it could not then claim to be based on Gregory\\'s book about Mary Boleyn.

In a strange way, the two films have a good deal in common. In an era in which everyone seems to want either tense thrillers, puerile comedies or awesome special effects (the only one here, as has been pointed out, is a cheaply put together tornado), both movies offer little more than a thoroughly improbable plot and a focus on character development. But both work remarkably well. I am puzzled by those who found that the movie dragged. While most of the plot development was telegraphed not once but several times, the acting from all three leads was both believable and very deft. At first I thought that Rachel McAdams\\' character was simply too naive to be true but it soon became apparent that she was much wiser than we (or even she) knew. She plays it beautifully. Tim Robbins is wonderful too, and rather pathetic, in a down-to-earth role as an aging war veteran, happy to have survived and soon to be confronted with some harsh realities. But Michael Pena was the real surprise. He is completely captivating in his portrayal of a proud young vet from a military family on his way to meet his girlfriend, with his masculinity compromised by a war injury. His character is the most subtly poignant as he confronts his own fears about his manhood, on several levels.<br /><br />Like all movies based on the Iraqi war, this seems to suffer from America\\'s desire to ignore the war altogether, just as they ignored the Vietnam veterans a generation ago (Coming Home, The Deer Hunter). America seems to be much less willing to address its failures now than it was then, or even the lesser failures in the wake of World War II.\"'],\n",

Perhaps even a film made to reunite the two actors in the hope of regaining the magic of the pairing.<br /><br />Whatever the reason, it doesn\\'t work.

In his spare time Virgil has also created horrible little killer dolls to do his bidding, first George Warbeck (Nicholas Worth) & Mercy Shaw (Jodie Coady) are taken care off then Virgil turns his attentions to Harrison Yulin (Warren Draper) & his scheming wife Moira (Debra Mayer) who just happens to be a dominatrix... Has Virgil met his match at last?<br /><br />Written, produced & directed by Charles Band & made under his Full Moon company this is yet another killer toy flick one maybe cynically would suggest is more interested in starting a new line of collectible toys than entertaining. Band has experience in the killer toy genre, Dolls (1987) & Puppet Master (1989) & it\\'s sequels, unfortunately Blood Dolls is terrible in pretty much every way. The story is absolutely none existent, seriously there is no story to speak of or worth mentioning at all. It\\'s just a few random scenes cobbled together more than a coherent film. There are some really bizarre things in Blood Dolls, for instance a four girl rock band who Virgil keeps locked in a cage & has them perform songs at regular intervals for no apparent reason. The fact that Virgil has an extremely small head, there\\'s absolutely no reason for it & it looks stupid but it\\'s here anyway. The fact that Virgil\\'s servants consist of a guy in clown make-up & a dwarf add another unusual spin on proceedings without ever making any sense in their own right. Then there\\'s the fact that Moira is a dominatrix, the film comes alive when she goes into mistress mode & abuses her husband & her scenes are the only reason I\\'m giving Blood Dolls 3 stars instead of 1. Unfortunately her dominatrix scenes are few & far between & once her husband is killed off she becomes \\'normal\\' as it were & the film then dies a slow painful death. There\\'s also a pointless double ending like in Clue (1985) where one thing happens & then an alternative it could have also happened like this ending is shown which just makes the whole film even more pointless.<br /><br />Director Band was obviously working on a low budget, the doll effects are poor & they have little movement. There\\'s hardly any blood or gore, someone gets bashed over the head with a lifting weight, someone gets a scalpel in the eye, a guy is killed when wires dig into his flesh & a drill burrows into someones chest with lots of blood splatter. Otherwise this is virtually bloodless. There\\'s nothing here scary, there\\'s no atmosphere or tension & the story sucks. Apart from a few fun scenes with Moira as a dominatrix Blood Dolls has nothing going for it & is utterly forgettable. Even the dolls themselves are bland & look cheap, none of them stand out as being \\'cool\\' or particularly threatening.<br /><br />Technically the film is basic, it appears to be shot in the same few rooms & the special effects consist of nothing more than a few plastic dolls moving their arms & heads. Every so often the rock group perform a song, they can\\'t sing & all I can say is thank god for the mute button! The acting is OK, dominatrix Debra Mayer steals every scene shes in.<br /><br />Blood Dolls is a cheap, poor, plot less attempt at starting another killer toy franchise by Charles Band, do yourself a big favour & watch Puppet Master, Dolls or Child\\'s Play (1988) again instead. Apart from Mayer\\'s dominatrix scenes this is pretty damned bad & as far as I\\'m concerned has nothing going for it.\"'],\n",

The movie was loaded with all kinds of footage from the 1950\\'s, and included in this footage was some ancient looking film clips of the students in High School in Hicksville, NY.

It was a collage of old films and reminders of an era past that people were trying to remember by the early 1970\\'s. The makers of this film used a technique where they had one inmage on one side of the screen and another image on the other side.

The two young male leads were effective and likable, and sympathetic in their own back story.<br /><br />The effectswork is terrific yet not overdone, fitting seamlessly into the storyline to visually tell the story of the horrors committed by this family, and the film is very well supported by the music score of Steve Jablonsky, who develops the atmospheric tonality developed for the 2003 remake and crafts a musical design that maintains a constancy of dread and a rhythmic, panic-inducing pulse during the action scenes. The main theme, a horn melody intoned over a rhythmic underworking of fast-moving violins, really drives the film\\'s excitement when it\\'s not creating haunting tonalities during the suspenseful moments. Jablonsky\\'s reprisal of Leatherface\\'s theme is especially moving when he puts on the face of one of his victims, wearing the human mask (the \\\\\"leather face\\\\\") for the first time \\x96 the score crescendos in a slow ascent of triumph, yet tinged with the horror relevant in that triumph. John Larroquette\\'s narration at the end neatly tied into his opening monologue for the 2003 remake \\x96 not to mention the original 1974 film.<br /><br />As the latest take on the TCM franchise, the film, beyond being a terrific and not-for-the-squeamish horror picture, adds to the TCM mythology and illuminates the dementia behind America\\'s most ghoulish family, although it fails to provide an truly adequate psychological explanation or rationale to the events of the family\\'s cannibalistic origin beyond suggestion that they were a survivalist reaction to circumstances. THE BEGINNING covers the events that started the family\\'s rural rampage of murder; real insight into what makes the family, and the character tick, wasn\\'t really what this film was about.\"'],\n",

Moreover- many of these same persons have no ability ( or desire ) to make the connection of those years( 1933-1945 ) as to how the world is now formulated. Director Dan Curtis has exhibited both the will and ability to take both Herman Wouk\\'s novel and incorporate it so successfully into this massive, and titanic film. I believe, that both WoW and W & R, along with \\\\\"Saving Private Ryan \\\\\" should be required film watching for all graduating high schoolers. Admittedly many of the films realistic and gritty scenes are difficult to watch- but unfortunately reality is often a cruel place. Both WoW and W&R give an honest lesson on the eventual triumph of the forces of good over evil which the world faced in the middle of the 20th century. The side stories of the characters involved and their individual romances and escapades only solidify the historical significance of the film. My favorite scenes involved the accurate depiction of the battle of Midway. Midway probably saved several years of hard Pacific fighting and thousands of lives as a result of the American victory. Grade A+ performances for Robert Mitchum and Jane Seymore. Steven Berkoff was masterful as Hitler and Jeremy Kemp continued his credible role as the sympathetic and loyal General Armin von Roon. Barry Morse also deserves credit for being able to switch roles from the slimy Wolf Stoller in WoW to a wise but challenging General Halder in W& R ( One goof- Halder was not executed in the aftermath of the July 22, 1944 attempt on Hitler as depicted in the film- he survived the war ).

       "  '\"I have just finished watching the Complete Series DVD collection of \\\\\"Freaks and Geeks,\\\\\" one of the best high school television series on televisions that, thanks to idiotic network executives who continue to make the decisions that make network television more and more unbearable to watch, have truly missed out on a gem. And, thanks to a healthy fan network, I was able to enjoy every bit of the series (as short as it was) on DVD.<br /><br />Freaks and Geeks was one of the most honest portrayals of high school life, pleasantly departing from the overrated attention given to other television series and films who consistently focus on the \\\\\"untouchable\\\\\" classes of the dreaded high school social caste system that we are all likely too familiar with. The assorted teen dramas, and the difficulty of just subsisting in the often passively rigid classes within the high school social scene. This television series presented things from two perspectives: a group of freshman friends marked as \\\\\"The Geeks\\\\\" and a group of older friends, underachievers known as \\\\\"The Freaks.\\\\\" The Geeks often provided the comical element to the show, while the Freaks often explore more dramatic story lines such as problems with parents (a constant subplot), self-esteem, drugs, and more. Although the Geeks confronted their own share of problems, their youth and easygoing attitude often made the situation more light-hearted.<br /><br />Other commentators have often posited the question (on the \\\\\"Freaks and Geeks\\\\\" board along with other short-lived television series) why shows like these never last long on television. While \\\\\"Saved by the Bell\\\\\" might have been the only show to be quite successful with it (though only after significant retooling of the original series, \\\\\"Good Morning Mrs. Bliss would NBC even agree to pick up the show), my guess is that this show may have initially had a difficult time finding a loyal audience in the crucial early days of the show. There were issues of drug use and teenage sex which some might not have found ideal for the younger viewers of this show (people in their very early teens as this show tended to sometimes celebrate drug use...even though there was one episode that was clearly anti-drug). Five years ago was a different time, however. And shows like \\\\\"The O.C.\\\\\" (on Fox) seems to get away with stories surrounding its \\\\\"young\\\\\" characters and attitudes towards casual sex. Sadly, however, the network, too, is to blame, as it shifted the show into unrecognizable time slots, airing a show that was ideal for young audiences at a time when they would least likely be watching television--Friday and Sunday evenings. I cannot say that this would be why other television series surrounding high school would also be canceled.<br /><br />It might also be that the show was never given a fair chance. Some might have quickly judged it as a rip-off of \\\\\"The Wonder Years\\\\\" (John Daly and the Geek Gang--especially Neil and Harris--did look like characters you might find on that show, not to mention the high school looking just like that in The Wonder Years).<br /><br />My other guess for the reason that shows like these are often short-lived is that they are too expensive to produce. \\\\\"Freaks and Geeks,\\\\\" like \\\\\"My So-Called Life\\\\\" filled a lengthy time slot of fifty minutes or so. Filmed partially on location and partially on a set (like \\\\\"Sqaure Pegs\\\\\" and \\\\\"My So-Called Life\\\\\"), a show like this becomes very expensive to produce and, may unfortunately force some hasty decisions about how long a network would ride out slack ratings.<br /><br />I still think NBC passed up a good thing, and possibly other networks if it was pitched to them once being canceled. It was a great show that tried to produce a very dynamic set of characters and stories and did well.<br /><br />I would also like to say while I adored nearly every character on the show (except for Nick who\\'s obsession with Lindsay transformed him into not only a bizarre, but a boring character), I thought Martin Starr was the best as the witty Bill Haverchuck (I love his Bionic Woman bit when he is getting his costume ready in the Halloween episode). Though I thought him to be needlessly bizarre in the beginning (particularly due to his gawky appearance), he turned out to be one of the best characters. He always tried his best to be a good friend to everyone and, he always had some of the funniest lines in th show (Joe Flaherty, as Sam\\'s dad, also had a bunch of good one-liners). And, while he was not in the show but sporadically, I also loved \\'Harris,\\' the Geek mentor who always seemed so confident about everything.<br /><br />Long live Freaks and Geeks! May the television show\\'s creators reconsider trying this one again (even if you have to start over with a new cast, since everyone has aged six years--as of this writing).\"'],\n",

       "  '\"Based on a Broadway play, ANOTHER LANGUAGE is one of those gems from yesteryear that few have heard of. It has much to recommend it, chiefly: believable and detailed interaction among members of a rather large and unpleasant family, mostly given to self absorption but with moments of genuine compassion and caring that surface unexpectedly. One of the members of this family is Margaret Hamilton (who was in the Broadway original) in one of the few roles that allowed her to enact a somewhat complex human being. Louise Closser Hale is perfectly cast as the controlling, selfish mother who sets the tone for her whole brood. Helen Hayes, a supremely skilled actress who could play ordinary people and make them fascinating, wins the viewer over completely as the bride who runs afoul of her in-laws. I wanted to marry her myself! The standout, however, is young John Beal who delivers a passionate performance as Robert Montgomery\\'s younger brother. ***POSSIBLE SPOILER FOLLOWS*** His character is introduced well after the conflict between Hayes and the family is established. He is appalled that his family is treating Hayes so shabbily and falls madly, dangerously, recklessly in love with her. His vital, fresh-faced, youthful innocence and earnestness captivate the viewer. He too had played the same role in the stage version. This performance might have launched Beal to the top of the Hollywood firmament, but Hollywood didn\\'t suit him, and he settled into a 60-year career of minor films, regional theater and numerous TV roles. Montgomery himself is top notch, as usual, playing the insensitive product of his narrow-minded mother\\'s upbringing. Don\\'t let the conventional opening scene as Hayes and Montgomery disembark from their honeymoon cruise fool you. It gets better fast. The theme is similar to that of HOLIDAY, based on a Philip Barry play, in which a free-spirited outsider clashes with members of his fiancée\\'s stodgy, traditional banking family.

       "  '\"Firstly, some reviewer has claimed the events of the movie are dated to 1789. It is wrong. By that time Diderot was already dead (1713-1784). The year 1789 appears in the beginning of the movie as a date of French revolution to which Diderot was a kind of forerunner. The right dating seems to be 1750\\'s, when Diderot should have been about his 40, as it comes also from his daughter age and from Boucher\\'s painting, which the company views during the sideshow in the end of the movie. This painting was executed in about 1752. <br /><br />Now despite all these historical correspondences, the viewer must understand - this movie is not about Diderot\\'s real life, it is a fantasy, which includes personage named Denis Diderot, who in some instances has some common features with historical person Denis Diderot. <br /><br />Now, when you come to see the movie, try to forget all you know (if you do) about the real Diderot and just enjoy the jokes, the funny situations and delightful absurdities of the movie. If you\\'ll do this, you will really love the film. To some sever judges I would suggest reading Rabelais. Humor is a special genre, with its special rules and demands, and most important, with a lot of very diverse faces. You can not evaluate it departing from your personal ideology, philosophy or whatever, you should concern it in its own terms and believe me, such are exist. <br /><br />Le Libertin is a light and wonderfully filmed comedy. It leaves you with a kind smile on your lips when the last frame makes its place to titles and a strong wish to watch it again immediately. <br /><br />The cast is incredible, especially Fanny Ardant who (as she always do) manages to create truly complex personage. <br /><br />Nudity is natural, not hidden, not shaming - in a painful contrast with puritan Hollywood. The same is true regarding the matters of sexuality. <br /><br />Gabriel Aghion made a good job, and thanks to Le Libertin, Pédale Douce and Belle Maman I am ready to forget his disastrous Pédale Dure. <br /><br />Really recommended to anyone who is ready to open his mind to things that may be not exactly of his style.\"'],\n",

Fortunately, Joe Brooks handled the direction, writing, and lead acting role himself, so there are fewer people to blame for it.<br /><br />As a romantic lead, Joe has about as much appeal as a potted plant. His leading lady, Shelley Hack, acts as though she were posing for the picture on front of a box of All Bran. It\\'s pretty bad when the most professional acting performance in a movie is delivered by a little girl (Danielle Brisebois).<br /><br />Joe plays a jingle writer who dreams of being a serious musician, even though all of his \\\\\"serious\\\\\" songs still sound like extended jingles, and the classical piece he composes to show off his true talent would be better suited for a group of musical saw players instead of an orchestra. Watching his dramatic gestures as he conducts this ear-splitting opus in the recording studio, as the dazzled Shelley Hack grins at him like a stuffed loon, is one of the most unintentionally hilarious scenes ever filmed.<br /><br />Joe was obviously hoping for another big chart-topper like \\\\\"You Light Up My Life\\\\\", but its inexplicable success was not to be matched by the cringe-inducing dirge that is this film\\'s theme song. I don\\'t know who performed it, but he doesn\\'t sing it as much as he suffers through it. He seems to be battling his way through a particularly intense bout of constipation as he strains to expel the stomach-churning lyrics.

       "  '\"I came away from Dead Man\\'s Shoes with a sense of pride; a sense of acknowledgment; a feeling that British film at its lowest budget level and at its grittiest and simplest is very much alive and active. The reaction I had also affected the way I perceive Hollywood a little bit more; it\\'s true that films like Zodiac, Blood Diamond and Apocalypto occupy my top three of 2007 but even some of them and the many others on that list do not match the fondness and recognition that I had for Dead Man\\'s Shoes upon seeing it \\x96 the great thing is, this was extensively levelled down in terms of funding but pumped up in terms of quality. Make no mistake, Dead Man\\'s Shoes is very good.<br /><br />I suppose in order to identify this film, I\\'d have to borrow from America somewhat but that is no shame; this film is 1988\\'s Rain Man meets a hard as nails, gritty revenge film \\x96 perhaps something staring James Cagney in his pomp. But it is a revenge film with an air of indifference; the film is often funny, often touching and often heart-warming in its portrayal of inept small time crooks, its nasty flashbacks of bullying and its small inclusion of scenes in which someone with special needs is present and displaying his innocence. While I have only seen the rather underwhelming Once Upon a Time in the Midlands from director Shane Meadows, this isn\\'t so much as a jolt back in the right direction as it is a full blown shove back onto the correct tracks. Meadows directs and unfolds his story in a brilliant manner but in a manner that utilises so many techniques that we the audience flip from happy to sad to anger to disgust and in such a way that we have time to appreciate what we\\'re seeing; feeling and what we think of it all.<br /><br />Paddy Considine plays Richard, a soldier fresh back from, what I can only assume to be, the horrors of Iraq and the Iraq war going on. But where road side bombs and ambushes have been erased, Richard is psychologically stuck with constant explosions going off in his mind \\x96 anger, rage, sadness and that lust for revenge when he learns his younger, more simple brother has suffered torment and bullying at the hands of the local drug dealers and young adults who have not matured enough to shake off that \\'chav\\' mentality. Needless to say, he brings home the horrors of Iraq with him in all their bloody infamy in what could be one of the best post-war syndrome studies since Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver. The film poster of said film on someone\\'s flat wall perhaps hints at this.<br /><br />But apart from the horror and the tragedy, which does grab you thanks to some flashbacks that I eventually came to fear popping up, everything is revealed in a satisfying and balanced way. Initially, the users of the boy call him over and tap him on the back and invite him in and everything seems very harmless; we even think he is close enough to these people to go out and get some groceries for them if nothing else is on. But whatever we thought is quickly presented to us over and over in a, frankly, quite brilliant piece of directing and pacing as we realise these people are not what they are cracked up to be. Further utilisation of the kid follows; then it gets more serious when drugs and women come into play. Meadows also gets across the element of humour early on in his film; indeed, when you see Herbie (Wolfenden) trundle down the road in his Citroen 2CV with the other guys in the back, you cannot help but smirk at how real this all feels; at how these people are presented as people who live, breath, hang around in apartments and drive obscure cars.<br /><br />But then again, you get the feeling of disturbance. We are not aware of the true extent of things until much later but looking back at the events in the opening hour, the leisurely way in which the gang hang around and talk about nothing in particular considering what they have done is shocking. Meadows also gets across his feeling of foreboding and the sense its all building up to something. Richard\\'s initial work that he carries out on the gang all feels as if it builds up to the big showdown with the final gang member; the one member we will feel a juxtaposition toward since he has a wife and two children. Onto the wrongdoers in question; initially, Herbie is introduced but then we get two of his lackey accomplices living in an apartment; onto a further pair of heavies that come over and finally, Sonny (Stretch) who is the chief antagonist in the bullying of the brother \\x96 to him, it goes beyond a joke; it turns into an actual hatred, a hatred of those with special needs with elements of fascism towards those who are not \\'normal\\' starting to creep into the film and its character\\'s psyche.<br /><br />So this is Meadows introducing to us the villains in stages; the targets Richard must deal with if he is to get his revenge \\x96 we are systematically told what Richard is up against but there is also that nice little touch of Richard showing up now and again with scare tactics. But with a hero on a mission and a twist that packs a punch Dead Man\\'s Shoes is a big success. When he confronts the family man at the end, Richard himself says that he \\\\\"is now the monster\\\\\" which tells us that we do not have to root for him any more if we don\\'t want to as he is confronting an apparent innocent but the film is brilliant in its build up, its finale and its attention to detail - great stuff.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"The first thing that needs to be said about this movie, is something that should, and shall, be said about all Reb Brown movies. REB BROWN RUNS LIKE A GIRL. There, I am glad I have got that out of the way. This is something that is apparent from the word go in this movie. Yor dramatically enters, and proceeds to skip across the desert, arm flailing about, and generally he is looking like he has never ran across rough terrain before. I sure this wasn\\'t the intention. I\\'m sure, that the intention was for Yor to come across as quite adept and at home in this barren landscape. Equipped with nothing more than an axe, a loincloth and a fantastic theme tune, I sure he was supposed to appear to be some kind of natural hunter, at one with his surroundings and senses. But unfortunately, as I have said before, REB BROWN RUNS LIKE A GIRL.<br /><br />That said, everybody should be like Yor. Everybody should have their own them tune. A theme tune that not only can inspire you to achieve great things in your life, but can also inspire those around you to become better people, and put their absolute trust in you. Yor\\'s theme tune is great. It does all that a personal theme tune should do. It spontaneously burst into play whenever he does something slightly random, like killing a giant bat and using it as a hang glider, or performing fantastic trapeze stunts with an ageing, fat caveman who has man-boobs. But more about those incidents later.<br /><br />Yor is a hunter. Quite what he hunts is a mystery to me. With this movie apparently set in Pre-historic times, surely everybody is a hunter, therefore making the term \\'hunter\\' meaningless. Nonetheless, yor is a hunter. In this, his first and only movie, he quickly befriends the saggy old man, Pac, and a very clean cave woman called Kala. Together, they travel through prehistoric lands, accidentally destroying every single tribe, village or civillisation that they happen to come across. I mean all. Sorry to give that one away, but seriously. Yor is the cause of the destruction of no less than five tribes of people. Sometimes intensional, sometimes purely by accident. He is one of those people that you really would try your best to divert from your village. He is however, quite adept at killing mutated paper-mache dinosaurs. I say mutated, because they are quite simply like no dinosaurs I have ever seen, and react like no creatures I have ever heard of. The first being a cross between a stegosaurus and a triceretops, a tristegoceretops if you will. But after killing it, he does what every hunter would do, drinks it\\'s blood, but as he so wisely puts it, \\\\\"drinking the blood of your enemy makes you stronger\\\\\". Then there is the giant bat. The most useful creature in his entire world. Not only does it fly past at just the right time, but this creature conveniently goes into instant rigour Mortis, even before it hits the ground. This allows Yor to use the said bat as a hang glider to fly into a cave, rescue Kala, and you guessed it, entirely wipe out the tribe that kidnapped her. Fantastic stuff.<br /><br />This is a very interesting world, it has to be said.There are a few things that can be learnt from this movie. the first being you can make absolutely anything out of straw. Straw seems to be the most versatile substance in the entire world. Pac\\'s bow and arrows are made from it, villages are entirely made from it, they even sail a boat made from straw. Which bring me to my next learning point, if you are planning to sail to a place called \\'The island of Storms\\', don\\'t do it in a straw boat. That really is just asking for trouble.<br /><br />But it is at the island of storms that the movie takes an unexpected twist (at least it would be if the blurb on the back of the video box din\\'t tell you the entire plot of the movie). The movie gets invaded by a completely different movie altogether. But not just any movie, it gets invaded by a cheap remake of Star Wars. Led by the \\'Overlord\\' who is a dead ringer for the Emperor, and his team of robots, who are dead ringers for Darth Vader, they capture Yor and demand to take over the movie. Despite futile efforts to resist, Yor is eventually forced to submit to there demands and pick up his blaster rifle to continue the battle. Something which he learns to use confidently in a very short space of time. It is a skill he uses efficiently in his other movie, Space MUtiny, where he also RUNS LIKE A GIRL, SCREAMS LIKE A GIRL and generally acts ALL GIRLIE LIKE.\"'],\n",

A young man gets his wife out of a mental institution where she was kept after her baby drowned accidentally. The psychiatrist is really smug, he obviously enjoys telling the husband that with his wife anything could happen. The husband decides to visit with her a place where they spent their honeymoon.

I give you a hint: splutter, splutter.<br /><br />That is the typical start of a Good Bad Movie in anyone\\'s language. The subject is well known in the American horror genre: young, innocent people meet old, frustrated yet colorful country folk. Scenes of gore ensue. Added to this is the classical island theme of Agatha Christie\\'s Ten Little Indians \\x96 the young and innocent get killed one by one. The last surviving member of the \\x84involontary expedition\\\\\" fuses with the murderous opponents. Follows a gory finale. The end.<br /><br />Several points are worth mentioning that make American Gothic partly watchable. The movie is very beautiful. The plane flying over a group of islands in the opening sequence is visually great, and the dark, mossy virgin forest of the island where the group gets stranded reminded me of John Sayle\\'s Limbo (whose story has some similarity with American Gothic here and there). The set design is also excellent. An interesting aspect in the story is the fact that all the inhabitants of the island turn up out of nowhere. First, Ma and Pa surprise the youngsters in their house which they had entered in a clear case of trespassing, opening cupboards, taking out clothes etc. Later, suddenly a daughter turns up, then a son, then another. This strange and unexpected multiplication of characters has a stimulating effect on the viewer (are they ghosts, only existing in the imagination, are they some kind of mutants?) but is left unexplained.<br /><br />The acting is not bad \\x96 at least on the part of the strange family. Rod Steiger is quite good as the head of the family, Yvonne de Carlo is OK as the matriarch. Janet Wright and Michael J. Pollard are great as the demented kids.

Now I know that there are many Loretta Young and probably more Tyrone Power fans out there and I don\\'t mean to offend them. Heck, I usually love these actors, too, but I also can\\'t lie and say it\\'s one of their better films.<br /><br />The film starts off well enough and I really liked the first half.

So, on a lark, he gambles and actually earns enough to pay off the money he lent himself (illegally) and save his butt.

Instead of sending Power to jail for writing a bad check to cover his losses, Menjou decides to force Power into becoming his slave. And, as his slave, he has Power pose as a Russian prince so they can both bilk a rich young lady (Young) of the money to save the restaurant. So far so good.<br /><br />Now the fact that Power didn\\'t do so well with impersonating a Russian wasn\\'t a problem--after all, he wasn\\'t supposed to be perfect and she was supposed to eventually figure out that he was a phony. However, and here\\'s where the film gets dumb, although she knows he\\'s a criminal, she falls in love with him(????) and insists she must marry him. Now we could assume that either Miss Young\\'s character is schizophrenic or suffered a massive brain injury, but when her aunt agrees with her and they work hard to get Power (even after he\\'s robbed them), this strains common sense way beyond the breaking point. She barely knew the guy and most of what she knew about him was terrible---yet she insisted on marrying him and having everyone live happily ever after. And on top of this, Ms. Young yells and bellows and over-emotes like mad when she argues with her father about this. Oh, brother, give me a barf bag!! <br /><br />The only reason I even gave the film a score this high is that despite being brainless, the film had some nice moments and the actors seemed to try hard with material that was simply beneath them. Also, the film deserves no better than a 4 because some excellent dance scenes with Bill \\\\\"Bojangles\\\\\" Robinson were in the film but they were cut before it was released!!

The horrible acting or the laughable script. I love the idea that Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs is finally getting a starring vehicle but his performance here made me see why he never took off in Hollywood. It was truly THAT bad.<br /><br />The writing was wooden and incredible. Normal people don\\'t speak like these guys did. They go from laughing to crying to anger in minutes. Why would you beg a hitchhiker to get back in your car after 20 minutes of driving? Why would you reveal such incriminating details of your life story after knowing someone for an hour?

I\\'m no expert but here\\'s a tip: when showing a gritty, close up scene, try taking the camera off sticks and going hand-held to get an edgier, more nervous feel. I felt like I was watching public access theater for a while there.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good concept for a film. The execution, however, drowned the story in a sea of amateurish and obvious mistakes that kids in their second month of film school are warned against.<br /><br />I wish the actors and crew of this film long, fruitful careers in the entertainment industry but you\\'ll need to bury the masters of this stinker for that to occur.

       "  '\"I recently viewed this film for the first time and found it to be intriguing if not especially satisfying. I apparently viewed this film from a somewhat different perspective than many other IMDb voters. I don\\'t know the director\\'s intent, but I felt the film exemplified the drawbacks and pitfalls of extreme positions and/or lifestyles. The central character, vividly portrayed by Mimi Rogers, leads a very loose lifestyle in the initial stages of the film and converts to an overly rigid lifestyle in the latter stages after becoming disenchanted and seemingly depressed with what was transpiring in her life. Viewers can judge for themselves whether one type of extremism is preferable to the other. In my opinion, many types of groups or cults (politically or religiously inspired) capitalize on people searching for a person or group who can dramatically change what they perceive as an unrewarding existence. This film may draw, intense positive or negative, response from people with extreme religious positions. Not placing myself at either end of that spectrum, I was deeply interested in the film but felt that it lost some of its impact and possibly a couple of rating points, over the final half hour of the presentation.<br /><br />Mimi Rogers gives a strong performance in a film in which she is required to shoulder the burden. It\\'s not that the other actors give sub-par performances. It\\'s just that the film is so primarily structured around Mimi\\'s character that she is required to carry the load and does so extremely well. In my opinion, an IMDb rating of between 3 and 8 would seem to fit this religiously provocative drama. I personally gave it a 4 out of 10 and would recommend it for viewers who are not offended by loose sexual lifestyles or exploring intense religious attitudes.\"'],\n",

Thank God Nelson had more sense to drop a large hunk of semi-soft cheese into the middle of an outstanding masterpiece. Such a cliched and trite twist would have aboslutely ruined the film for me. Obviously, Nelson did not want to pedestrianise her masterpiece and so consciously steered away from such a soap-opera style conclusion.<br /><br />Penn\\'s performance is highly commendable - more Rainman than Forest Gump. Indeed, it represents what must surely be a turning point in his career direction.

       "  '\"Well I just got done watching this movie, thankfully for free on the SciFi channel. I must say I feel sorry for anyone who actually paid to see this movie. Although I have learned to not really expect much from the weekend Horror movies on cable, this one is really near bottom of the barrel material. The beginning was okay, and could be considered somewhat good by horror movie terms. However there was very little building on almost any of the characters in the movie. While Phil Jenkins, does have some background/build, mostly from just a couple scenes where he revealed some information about his past; as well as Pamela\\'s constant nickname of \\\\\"big city\\\\\" for him. All of the other characters just seem like cannon fodder. There to be picked off at a moment\\'s notice. I wasn\\'t impressed by the gore in this movie either, it wasn\\'t in the least bit frightening. That of course, could be the effect of seeing a few hundred different horror movies. I think this movie was mostly just slapped together hurriedly with a second rate script and mediocre actors. The acting in the scene where the girl gets out of the car and is crawling across the ground while being \\\\\"eaten\\\\\" by the werewolf is actually laughably bad. The attempt at a good plot twist at the end was pretty lame and very predictable if you\\'ve seen any kind of horror/suspense movie similar to this one. The fact that evil thing turns out to be the main character\\'s love interest is pretty dried up in terms of plot twists. It also seems to come very suddenly, without any building whatsoever. My overall view of this movie is that it should definitely be avoided at all costs. Unless you\\'re an absolute die-hard werewolf or random horror fan, don\\'t bother with this movie.\"'],\n",

If compared to Seabiscuit, yes, we have a horse with great potential faced with the troubles of breaking a leg during a competitive race. As with all race horses, this means instant death, as they have no future value, and are bred for the sole purpose of racing.<br /><br />We also have a superb trainer, Ben Crane, played by Kurt Russell, and the doctor (Holmes Osborne), the written-off jockey (Freddy Rodriguez), the stable-hand (Luis Guzman), etc. But here\\'s where the similarities end. Dreamer is a more personal film, with family friendly characters, like the daughter (Dakota Fanning), the wife (Elizabeth Shue), and the grandfather (Kris Kristofferson). Nursing the horse back to health had actually brought the family closer together, and that in itself makes this film quite cliché in its many \\\\\"been-there-done-that\\\\\" before moments to touch.<br /><br />Dakota Fanning has held her own against \\\\\"father-figure\\\\\" heavyweights like Robert De Niro, Denzel Washington, and Tom Cruise, though many would have pointed out that she had rivaled Naomi Watts for the 2005 Scream Queen honors with her performance in War of the Worlds. Here, Fanning has returned to more credible acting, albeit in a safer role.<br /><br />Dreamer: Inspired by a True Story, is a heartwarming tale about believing in oneself, having dreams, believing that you can achieve, and take action to achieve those dreams. While watching the movie, I can\\'t help but chuckle at the parallels in seeing how my team and I are sticking together, just like those characters, in wanting to see our dream of making a short film, and entering it into competitions (in this case, the Breeder\\'s Cup) come to a reality.<br /><br />It\\'s that kind of film, an inspiring one.

       "  '\"Thinking about it, I\\'m not a very big fan of Michael Crichton. Westworld is a good film, but Coma was disappointing; and this film, Looker, isn\\'t up to much at all. The early scenes and music indicate that the film is going to be another trashy eighties thriller, which is fine by me; but suddenly the film slows down to snail pace, and despite a few nice murder sequences early on; there really isn\\'t much to remember Looker for. For this film, Crichton has took ideas from the worlds of plastic surgery and advertising, and attempted to blend them into a horror/thriller. To say he wasn\\'t successful would be an understatement, as the plot requires a huge stretch of the imagination and the murders that happen early on never get anything in the way of an explanation. The film focuses on an eminent Beverley Hills plastic surgeon named Larry Roberts. After performing slight surgery on a number of almost perfect young women, he is surprised to find them turn up dead. After doing a bit of research, he stumbles on an advertising company called Digital Matrix, who have their own uses for \\'perfect\\' women.<br /><br />Given that this is an early eighties film, you\\'ve got to expect some tacky visuals and an even tackier soundtrack; but the film takes these elements and then delivers a story that is far too serious in tone, and it doesn\\'t bode well at all. Furthermore, Crichton\\'s plotting is awful as the film quickly becomes boring when the writer-director starts forgetting to explain things properly. You can\\'t fault him for imagination, as plastic surgery usually leads to an interesting film, and there\\'s no end of social commentary that can be sprung from the world of advertising; but in failing to capitalise on the story\\'s strong elements, Crichton has made what could have been a masterpiece into a dull and boring film. The acting isn\\'t bad, but again; nothing to write home about. Albert Finney is good in the lead role, and he receives welcome feedback from the likes of James Coburn and Susan Dey. The film isn\\'t all bad (just mostly), and there are a few memorable sequences; most notably a young girl falling several stories onto a car roof, and a scene at a dinner table towards the end; but I\\'m really surprised that this is given praise as an \\\\\"unsung movie\\\\\" - it certainly doesn\\'t deserve it!\"'],\n",

This group of movies also represented, I believe, an attempt by the studio to make Edna May Oliver (who was not British, by the way, but solidly American) a leading lady. That attempt failed, probably because she was not a sex symbol. But in the Penguin Pool Murder she wins over James Gleason by the sheer force of her character, and when he finally succumbs she characteristically responds, \\\\\"I thought you\\'d never ask!\\\\\" Or perhaps she was not cast more as a leading lady because she was, simply put, unsurpassed as a character actress.

Something evil is lurking and she\\'s there to put an end to it. She gains respect from her fellow pupils when she confesses to being a witch, when she performs curse on a hated teacher and it works. However it all changes, when the teacher actually turns up in a very severe accident. She gets the blame, as gossip spreads that people close to her die. During an after school exam, Misa and twelve students get locked in for the night and their teacher has disappeared. When they try to escape, there seems to be some sort of force stopping them from leaving and trying to kill them off. There only chance rests on Misa, but trying to convince them to trust her is another matter.<br /><br />We get a change of pace with this quirky, surrealistic, lurid and highly bold low-budget occult / supernatural / slasher J-horror film, which is inspired by Shinichi Koga\\'s 70\\'s Manga comics. Yes, there\\'s no vengeful spirits here. The film basically exploits its risqué moments at every opportunity with candid lesbian acts (teacher and student relationship) that follow onto unpleasantly gruesome details in what you can call spicy camp. <br /><br />Director Shimako Sato stylishly paints an edgy shocker with grisly set pieces worked into a claustrophobic atmosphere of dread, which hangs over the latter half of the film. The cheap feel to it all works to its advantage with its limited sets (basically all set in the school grounds), and the adept special effects and macabre make-up comes off extremely potent and well organised. While the majority of the pacing in the opening half slowly kicks off in first gear, it\\'s not until just after the halfway mark where the tempo gets frenetic and the blood splatter hits the fans. Lurking within the haunting context is a cold and creepy tenor, which makes the inventive deaths incredibly blood curdling. The sweeping camera work that\\'s dreamt up can capture some uncanny frames and lighting is kept rather under-lit to breath a really unsteady gloominess. In the background is a faintly effective and wistful music score. The story is nothing we haven\\'t seen before, but it still comes off fresh and stable with its interesting idea, which silly overtones can feature and convoluted actions creep up. Nonetheless it keeps a disorientating and tense feeling on how things are going to turn out in the end. <br /><br />There\\'s not much of a background to the witch Misa in this story, as she\\'s pretty much thrown right into this one and we got to accept it, even though this vagueness could frustrate. This would be the first of four chapters of this character. And the second entry (which isn\\'t too bad and reminded of \\\\\"The Terminator\\\\\") would go onto be a prequel, which explained a lot about Misa\\'s past and how she became to be a witch. The static script throws around plenty of witchcraft mumbo jumbo and lets the mystery unfold perfectly fine with few well-disguised red herrings and pawn-figures. The usual twists are also thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />Performances range from brooding to flamboyant, but either way it always amused. Kimika Yoshino in the lead part brings a quiet determination in her strong performance as Misa. Naozumi Takahashi lives it up, in the part of the jealous, wannabe wizard student and Miho Kanno keeps it all innocent and soft as Misa\\'s friend. A stellar Ryoka Yuzuki looks steamy, but strikes up a flinty barrier in her small part and Mio Takaki makes for a stoically steely turn as the teacher Shirai.<br /><br />A dark, foreboding teen J-horror film in the area of black magic, which it\\'s bumpy pacing can get just too causal. Well worth the peek for fans.\"'],\n",

But director Sergio Arau does so admirably in A DAY WITHOUT A Mexican.<br /><br />Part comedy, part mockumentary, the film\\'s liberal leanings are sure to turn some viewers off. Taking consistent jabs at prejudices (and hitting their target more often than not), the film takes on the premise that a strange, magical fog has surrounded California one fateful day, blocking all incoming and outgoing traffic, internet access, and all forms of communication. And this weird atmospheric disturbance has also taken away all of the Mexicans. The disruption to the Sunshine State is evident as fruit rots on trees, vegetable aisles in grocery stores go empty, and car wash patrons have to dry their own cars! Lilia Rod(riguez) played by Yareli Arizmendi (LIKE WATER FOR CHOCOLATE) is a television news reporter who DOESN\\'T disappear. The supernatural phenomenon seems to have passed her by even though she\\'s Mexican. Or is she? More unseen prejudices arise as we learn that most Anglos label anyone with a coppery-toned complexion as \\\\\"Mexican.\\\\\" Lilia learns her true genetic heritage along the way but feels, in her heart, that she\\'s Mexican and promptly vanishes in front of a television audience.<br /><br />John Getz (BLOOD SIMPLE) plays Senator Abercrombie who has to take on the position of California Governor Pro-Tem, as the current Governor and Lieutenant Governor were Mexican. Thrown into the spotlight, the new Gov has to deal with all of the chaos caused by the disappearances as well as the disruptions to his own household when their maid/nanny/cook vanishes.<br /><br />Other characters include two border patrol officers who are forced to deal with their prejudices when they learn that they no longer have a viable job. This is one particularly hilarious portion of the film that will really tickle audience\\'s funny bones.<br /><br />As California tries to deal with the loss of an entire race, the remaining folks come up with some great reasons for the Mexicans\\' disappearance. Some say that the sombrero is shaped like a UFO for a reason {wink!} Others believe it\\'s a form of the rapture, and the apocalypse is upon us. Still others believe that it is because the other races didn\\'t appreciate the Mexicans and so they just up and left. Regardless of the reason (true or not) the effect is felt throughout the State. Anglos and other nationalities turn to looting and diving into black-market fruits and vegies in order to save their restaurants. Talk shows swing from one extreme to the other, some saying their glad that the Mexicans are gone while others struggle to stay on the air with a skeleton crew (many camera operators were Mexicans).<br /><br />The film\\'s faults are that this probably won\\'t be for those who live outside California. A Day Without a Mexican has a fairly specific target audience. But the great message, often funny and poignant at the same time, cannot be denied: we all need each other, regardless of race.<br /><br />Special mention of the film\\'s musical soundtrack MUST be made, too.

       "  '\"This review covers both versions of \\\\\"Flatland\\\\\" released in 2007, one by Ladd Ehlinger, Jr. with a mostly unknown voice cast, and the other by Jeffrey Travis with some Hollywood big names providing the voices.<br /><br />The source material for both is the 1884 novella by Edwin A. Abbott, but the approaches of the two films differ radically. The book is a staple of science fiction, and one of the few to address mathematical issues at its core. Being a product of its time, the book is technically naive, and politically incorrect based on current sensibilities.<br /><br />The Travis film is visually slicker, but significantly shorter, and tackles philosophical issues relative to the passage of time from initial publication. As such, it tampers with the plot to mixed effect. Unlike some others, I have no problem with some of the revisions to the underlying plot since they do help bring some of the book\\'s major issues into somewhat sharper focus. On the other hand, they also add a \\\\\"feel good\\\\\" and politically correct sensibility that seems out of place.<br /><br />The Ehlinger film is much truer to its source material, which is both a strength and a weakness. Given a current perspective, its 19th century depiction of the political and social subjugation of women is a distraction that the Travis film avoids. It\\'s also a longer film and could have been more effective with some of the same plot and editing license employed in the Travis film. Where it does tamper with the plot, some of the decisions are questionable as other reviewers have pointed out.<br /><br />So which is better? In my opinion, the short answer is the Ehlinger film. Despite its length, political incorrectness, and technical inferiority (the animation of the Travis film is much more sophisticated), it resonates at a technical level to a degree that the Travis film can\\'t match. As a scientist, this means a lot to me. On the other hand, the Travis film resonates on an emotional level that the Ehlinger film can\\'t match. So the answer may be whether you\\'re looking for technical insight or emotional satisfaction.<br /><br />Most jarring in the Travis film is that, unlike the Ehlinger film, the animators never quite caught on to the implications of a two-dimensional universe. It is filled with objects which are instantly recognizable to us, yet would be clearly impossible or meaningless in the film\\'s reality (e.g. the protagonist\\'s daughter has toys which only make sense to someone with a 3-D perspective, and how does he open his briefcase?). The cover art is an obvious first impression example. The Travis film\\'s characters look more human, but ask yourself how their eyes work. One detail of the book is that looking at a Flatlander from above, all of his internal organs are clearly visible, as they should be. Travis\\' animators hint at this, but don\\'t meet it head-on. The Ehlinger film\\'s animators may not have had the resources to make as slick a film as Travis\\', but they obviously gave a great deal of thought to what they were doing (or maybe not, since the necessary designs were all in the book). In short, Travis had the budget, but Ehlinger had the passion for the project - albeit perhaps a bit too much respect for the source to create a truly superior adaptation.<br /><br />The differences reflect different target audiences, though. The Travis film is an educational short film which was obviously meant to be viewed by classrooms of middle school and high school students. As such, it had to be socially inoffensive while conveying concepts of geometry that would never occur to non-mathematicians. That it includes recognizable names voicing the characters will help it grab a bit more attention - an educational short film for the \\\\\"X-Files\\\\\" generation. The Ehlinger film would mostly appeal to people with a college level interest in mathematics, or others who are already familiar with the book.<br /><br />Neither film is perfect, but I\\'m giving the Ehlinger film a rating of 8 and the Travis film a rating of 6. Depending on your sensibilities, your conclusion may be exactly opposite of mine, so I hope this review includes enough information to guide you to an informed selection.<br /><br />Or, like me, you could simply buy both... ;-)\"'],\n",

We had a \\\\\"second run\\\\\" theater nearby where you could see films for a dollar or 50 cents before 2 o\\'clock, so I know I saw it at least a dozen times (it played at the theater for about 3 months). My Father coached little league for years for my older Brother and myself. Both are now deceased and I finally took a view at the DVD this week after not having seen it in more than 2 decades. To call it memory evoking is an understatement.<br /><br />Dad was neither a Buttermaker or a Turner as a coach. He would come right from work to the field and would be knocking out balls for fielding practice with his dress pants, Florshiem shoes, and always puffing that pipe filled with Middelton\\'s cherry-blend tobacco. We won our share of games and he always made it a priority that everyone played, and that the game was first and foremost, fun. We had our share of \\\\\"Turner\\'s\\\\\" in our leagues, and dad disliked those types to no end. I don\\'t know how many times later in life when meeting someone and they heard my last name, they would ask \\\\\"Did your dad coach little league? I had him one year as a kid, he was such a cool guy to play for.\\\\\" Dad thought that BEARS was a bit over the top with the drinking and language, but always admitted that gave him more laughs than any movie he had seen.<br /><br />I never saw any of BEARS sequel\\'s, the TV show, or the 2005 remake. There was just no point.

What was inappropriate for 1976 is now intolerable, and deservedly so. But it is those attributes that makes the film so unique.<br /><br />I think the character that stands out the most for me is Roy Turner, having been the son of a \\\\\"coach-dad\\\\\". I always left the theater loving dad even more for not being like him. Turner gave us a look at what I call \\\\\"Lombardi-isim\\\\\". Vic Morrow was such a great actor. It was hard seeing him playing a villain character when I always thought of him as the heroic Sgt. Saunders of COMBAT. When the championship game is over and the Yankees win, I picture that huge trophy sitting in an apartment years later, collecting dust and being just about as worthless as the wood and plastic it\\'s made of. Still in the possession of a bitter old lonely man wondering what happened with his family.<br /><br />Some time back, I spent a lazy Sunday just driving around and came across a league game of 13-14 year olds. I felt compelled to stop and watch a few innings. Oh how things have changed. The \\\\\"game chatter\\\\\" has been replaced with vulgar trash-talking. I saw a verbal exchange between a pitcher and hitter that led to a head hunting pitch. Nothing was done about it, and on the next pitch the batter took one to the helmet. The batter ended up being OK (I guess helmet technology has come a long way thank goodness), and the pitcher was ejected.

The story is cliché: a laundry girl, Nini (Françoise Arnoul), is discovered by a night club owner, Danglard (Jean Gabin). Danglard steals her from her baker boyfriend and drops his current girlfriend, both of whom come back for their former lovers. Nini has to choose whether to go back to her humble life with the baker, go on with the show with her employer, oh, or become a princess, as a prince falls in love with her at one point, too. I\\'m glad the film didn\\'t go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have. The film ends with the opening of Danglard\\'s new night club, the Moulin Rouge, and a couple of gorgeous song and dance numbers. The first of them, \\\\\"Complainte de la Butte,\\\\\" which also provides the base of most of the film\\'s musical score, is simply one of the most gorgeous songs ever written, and Renoir himself wrote it. If you\\'re a fan of Baz Luhrmann\\'s 2001 film Moulin Rouge!, you\\'ll recognize the tune, as it comes up near the beginning of that film, sung by Rufus Wainwright.

Lee\\'s witty, sophisticated, but dramatically well-rounded yarn \\\\\"The Best Man\\\\\" is the latest to capitalize on this trend. Despite some profanity and raunchy sexual allusions, \\\\\"The Best Man\\\\\" endorses marriage, fidelity and religious values. Nobody gets shot, stabbed, or coked up the nose. The characters qualify as intelligent, positive, upscale role models and stereotypes appear conspicuously absent in this seriocomic account of a weekend college reunion before a classmate\\'s wedding.<br /><br />Happily, \\\\\"The Best Man\\\\\" shuns racism either as a political issue or as a narrative theme. Actually, this lighthearted but occasionally down to earth comedy of errors looks and sounds like something Oscar Wilde or George Bernard Shaw might have penned. The point is that \\\\\"The Best Man\\\\\" emerges as a polished mainstream comedy where the characters are first and foremost people with all of the foibles and frailties of mankind. A strong ensemble cast headed by charismatic Taye Diggs, who won over audiences in \\\\\"When Stella Got Her Groove Back,\\\\\" distinguishes writer Lee\\'s accomplished directorial debut. Unlike his famous, more often controversial brother Spike Lee, Malcolm sticks to the story and avoids tangents.<br /><br />Chicago author Harper Stewart (Taye Diggs of \\\\\"Go\\\\\") has just written his first novel. Appropriately entitled \\'Unfinished Business,\\' Stewart\\'s about to be published story has been picked up by Oprah Winfrey\\'s book club. Life couldn\\'t be better for the novice novelist. The froth of Harper\\'s success fizzles when he learns that his ex-college flame, BET-TV producer Jordan Armstrong (Nia Long of \\\\\"Friday\\\\\") has circulated an advance copy of his semi-autobiographical effort among his close chums. When Harper arrives in New York City for the weekend festivities surrounding the impending marriage of football star Lance Sullivan (Morris Chestnut of \\\\\"Half Past Dead\\\\\") and Mia Morgan (Monica Calhoun of \\\\\"Love & Basketball\\\\\"), he finds himself up to his ears in hot water.<br /><br />Naturally, Harper\\'s friends have perused his novel. They bicker about who he used as models for his fictional characters. Things come to a boil when Lance suspects the worst. He believes that his sweetheart Mia may have bedded down with Harper, the guy he chose to serve as his best man. Reluctantly, Harper confesses, and the once philandering football star blackens his eye at their stag party and then threatens to throw him off the balcony. Lance calls off the wedding without warning Mia and then storms out of the party. Harper realizes grimly that he must patch things up. The next day everybody shows up at the church in their finest garb, but poor Mia has no idea why Lance is tardy.<br /><br />\\\\\"The Best Man\\\\\" is the equivalent of Terry McMillan for guys. They form a closely-knit group of friends who have achieved success of their own right after college. Predictably, their reunion sparks old rivalries and bitter jealousies. Harper finds himself in trouble long before he arrives in the Big Apple to celebrate with his friends. Just as his publishing career is gaining momentum, Harper\\'s girlfriend goads him about a commitment that he balks at giving. Quentin (Terrence Howard of \\\\\"Iron Man\\\\\") is a cynical career drifter who cannot find a woman for himself but who doles out advice to Julian Murch (Harold Perrineau, Jr., of \\\\\"The Matrix Reloaded\\\\\") about how to deal with his prima donna girlfriend Shelby (Melissa De Sousa of \\\\\"Biker Boyz\\\\\"). Finally, Lance has decided to settle down now that he has inked a $5-million contract to play for the New York Giants.<br /><br />\\\\\"The Best Man\\\\\" towers as a four-star romantic comedy in the tradition of \\\\\"The Big Chill\\\\\" with characters who never get short-changed and an ending that is agreeably believable.\"'],\n",

While a child may seek the love a missing parent, they don\\'t seek love in general as a disembodied ideal. Likewise for Wall-e. Here, barely three minutes after Wall-E is introduced, he\\'s dreary little headcase pining for love, which is a limp idea dramatically for a kids film, and forces half the problems that ensue. The other half come from the wearying agenda, and this is coming from someone who is relieved we are finally in the green era.<br /><br />Vain, high-concept viewers have taken pride in their ignorance of a device here, which is old news; large stretches of silence are novel only to audiences who are unfamiliar with Jaques Tati, the 28 silent minutes that open 2001, enormous silent stretches of the ingenious Blow-Up (& countless other examples) and who can\\'t fathom the silent era.<br /><br />The movie asks two tiny things of an audience; to nod in agreement with its simpleton moral pronouncements, and to pass the time distracted by a bunch of surface activity. Right in the middle, between those two things, is where any good movies soul resides, what the movie ask you to cogitate over; ideas! Sorry no ideas here, just an abundance of messages: Towers of garbage taller than the skyscrapers we built (check, message delivered) An indictment of bignesss and Wal-mart (check, message delivered) Headed by a craven CEO (check, message delivered) A single remaining plant (check, messaged delivered) A space-ark filled with helpless fatties (check, message delivered) etc. etc. etc. etc. (message delivered).<br /><br />A glimpse into the future has never been so hopelessly stuck in the narrative past, and never looked so much like Victorian corn. The movie just cannot rest until a parade of morals has been pounded home. There is little sense of wonder in it. It ain\\'t surprising that it was directed by the guy who made Little Nemo.<br /><br />The movie becomes exactly as dreary, tiring and preachy as the premise of a largely wordless movie about ecology sounds.

I can understand why Connery would want to re-image himself, especially since his time as James Bond was approaching its end. What I have a hard time understanding is why he would choose such a poor movie to do it with. Here, he plays Duke Anderson - a career criminal who has just been released from prison and immediately begins plotting his next job - robbing the six wealthy residents of the apartment house in which his prostitute girlfriend (played by Dyan Cannon, in a role that accomplished little except to give a sort of logical reason why this place would be targeted) lives. He puts together a team made up partly of guys he knew on the inside, partly of old cronies from the outside and one guy from the local mob. Throughout the movie, it seems as though everyone\\'s being taped (thus, the title) - but to no end, since the tapes really end up playing no role whatsoever. And, in the end, I wondered about the police - it looked like half the NYPD was on this job!<br /><br />I thought this movie was poorly written, poorly acted and poorly paced. It\\'s hopelessly dated, reeking of the 70\\'s and with an absolutely dreadful musical score.

There are thousands upon thousands of simultaneously talented and attractive actors/actresses in Hollywood and beyond that wouldn\\'t refuse a role in a theatrically released horror flick with a $2.5 million budget. Instead, we get a reasonably attractive cast without enough talent to fill a proverbial thimble. The writing is terrible and unoriginal, and the dialogue is worsened with these actors. The setting, however, is absolutely beautiful at the southern California ranch in Santa Clarita. First-timer George Bessudo worked well with the film, creating some good suspense and utilizing some cringeworthy gore. Unfortunately, teamed with the amateurish script and embarrassing cast, it turned out to be a rather muddled mess. The script & acting cannot be made up for, and the majority of the film feels like a subpar combination of The Hills Have Eyes, Cabin by the Lake (remember that one?), and any lame teens-in-the-woods horror with Rob Zombie\\'s Michael Myers as the killers. I\\'m left with just one question to ask: \\'Where did the other $2.4 million go from the projected budget of $2.5 million? Booze & hookers?

It\\'s not that the story is so bad, although it\\'s not particularly outstanding in any way, but the acting is just abysmal on the part of the two lead characters, meaning those other than the regulars in this case. Barbara Anderson gives her weakest performance ever as the daughter of a mass killer, and who is on a mission of a sort. She practically calls in the role from a phone, and shows no real emotive abilities here. Although usually she\\'s never used as more than a pretty face in most of her film/TV roles,usually small parts, she has done much better.<br /><br />Arnold Moss as her father gives new meaning to the term \\'Ham\\' and is the only actor ever on a 1960s Star Trek episode that outdid William Shatner in this area, and actually makes Shatner look superb by comparison.

I say this because I told my brother the whole plot ending at the first commercial break when we were watching the original 1966 broadcast as pre-teens.

       "  '\"I rented this movie from my public library along with Beverly Hills cop 1 and 2.The first two were really great and when I was about to put it in I had a thought of \\'how bad could it be\\'.Well the first 10 minutes were good but then all the comedy and good acting got taken away.I only became excited once when they had George Lucas has a cameo so thats not really saying much. My suggestion is see the first two movies and dont ruin them by renting this god awful one. The bottom line is that it had a very bad plot,very bad acting,not enough comedy my rating 2/10.\"'],\n",

And the many boys, who\\'s story this is, are a delight. With it\\'s colorful, comic events and adventure, it became my favorite.<br /><br />Mama plays great too, and the director has a gentle and good touch for all the other kids, which means he is a fine craftsman.<br /><br />Though details elude our memory, I recall an inexplicably cheerful little man and people in colored saran wrap. I fail to see what was \\\\\"great\\\\\" about the land, other than a volcano that burped glitter. Moments after viewing it, I need only say the title to send everyone into fits of laughter and gagging sounds. This earns \\\\\"The Doghouse Fire\\\\\" my resounding two thumbs way up. Were we to judge it on a star ratings system, it would be a spangled banner.<br /><br />Soft, laid back, nostalgic and utterly charming, this story is a heartwarming winner, and can\\'t be recommended enough !! What an enormous pleasure !\"'],\n",

It is hard to imagine what the editors must have been thinking when splicing together all of the scenes in this movie. The writing fits perfectly and melds Steve Martin\\'s Rigby Reardon character with scenes from some of my favorite film noir. Favorite scenes include Rigby inviting himself to a party hosted by Ingrid Bergman, the scenes with Humphrey Bogart (talking about Bogey\\'s tie... too funny), Rachel Ward\\'s Juliet removing the bullet from Rigby\\'s arm, and it goes on and on. This is a must see for fans of Steve Martin, Carl Reiner, and all of those wonderful old movies.\"'],\n",

What a fabulous movie!! A topic that could have been boring was brought to life by director Katja von Garnier, as well as wonderful performances by Julia Ormond, Molly Parker, Vera Farmiga, and the amazing Hillary Swank, who brings chills with her powerful monologues. The soundtrack, despite not being from the 1910s or 1920s, is also a great listen.<br /><br />An important piece of history brought to life that all women should see and appreciate.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"Though moderately entertaining, there are too many things you have to overlook to make it one cohesive movie. So let\\'s begin. <br /><br />Let\\'s first overlook the fact that the movie butchers physics- you would think they\\'d at least bring someone on staff that knows SOMETHING about wormholes etc. to at least attempt to ground this movie in science. They didn\\'t. Since it\\'s a fictional movie- this is forgivable - we\\'ll overlook that it (producing wormholes) can\\'t possibly happen and the science behind it is laughable. Secondly, they never really explain why there are two of him - is this some sort \\\\\"The Prestige\\\\\" rip-off? My thought is if you send someone into the past - that\\'s changing the past and there is only one of the person- you\\'re not cloning someone - they use all this fake science mumbo-jumbo to make you try to answer your own question or just ignore the fact there\\'s two of him. Give me a concrete answer on why there\\'s two of him (and how he makes it back to the future when it hasn\\'t worked before--why this time? because it\\'s Denzel?) It also seems they kind of just ignore the fact he most probably killed his partner, probably 40-50 people on the highway by driving recklessly(if not killed, paralyzed) to save the girl that he had a crush on (real romantic). Let\\'s also overlook all the scenes where they spied on the girl in the shower and changing - because they should be arrested for that considering that\\'s pretty illegal and inappropriate. I\\'m going to start rambling so bear with me- she pulls a gun on him- and he makes a joke that he didn\\'t know that was going to happen - but he really should have, they pass it off as a joke because they can\\'t explain that scene. The ending where they drive the truck off of the boat - in a stroke of divine intervention- they crash through all the immobile cars -with the distance they had - maximum they could be going 15 MPH - yet they plow through and manage to not only drive the truck OFF the ship, but get it way up in the air to flip around. That\\'s impressive! My last huge qualm about the movie is- when he heads towards the bayou at the end, he\\'s in SUCH a hurry - yet - at the girl\\'s house they spend so much time bandaging him and are in no hurry. That scene would lack ANY suspense if they hurried up at her house and didn\\'t park right out front of the Bayou.<br /><br />In my opinion, this movie would have been better served having Denzel die - the girl get sucked into the ships propeller (to have her fingers cut off) and wash up on the ocean shore to show that you can\\'t mess around with the past or to elaborate more on the \\'human sacrifice\\' line of the movie.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"This film, directed by Eric Styles, has the distinction that it has reversed the emphasis from a woman, to a man, for being the object of sexual desire. Otherwise, it doesn\\'t make much sense. The best redeeming factor is some of the great views of Paris.<br /><br />Sarah, as played by Melanie Griffith, is annoying. That little girl voice in a grown up woman is a turn off. This is a mature woman that has taken up with a much younger, and attractive young man who is seen naked, and or, in different stages of it, in the film. Sarah makes a grave mistake in taking the train back to Paris and holding the precious coin in her hand while she falls asleep! Hellooo! She could have hidden in some other part of her body!<br /><br />Jack, the young man about town, is attracted to the newly arrived American ingenue, Jenny. They immediately fall in love and are seen having sex without any protection. Sorry, but has anyone heard of AIDS? Jenny is made to look terribly provincial with that horrible permanent and her even uglier pigtails.<br /><br />The film doesn\\'t go anywhere, as we figured what was going to be the outcome early on. The direction doesn\\'t help matters at all. Other than a vacation in Paris, what is Malcom McDowell doing in this movie? He only appears in one scene and is seen in another! This film could have been cast with lesser known actors and probably would have been better than what one sees on the screen.<br /><br />Better luck to Mr. Styles next time out.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"The made for TV film Primal Force begins with Frank Brodie (Ron Pearlman) waking up from a recurring nightmare about his mate being killed by some Baboons. There is a knock on Frank\\'s door, he answers it & standing before him is a guy named Scott Davis (Mark Kiely) who has been told that he knows San Miguel Island better than anyone else & that he needs his help to lead a rescue mission as a plane recently crashed there. Eventually Brodie agrees, together with a female medic named Tara Matthews (Roxana Zal) a computer guy named Stan Kovacs (Julian Sedgwick) & Eddie Mendoza (Guillermo Rios) who carries a gun, gets in the way & does very little else, they set off for San Miguel Island. Meanwhile on the Island itself the three survivors, the pilot (Jimy Hefner), a real estate guy named Deutsch (Richard Fancy) & a pretty young girl named Kelsey Cunningham (Kimberlee Peterson) whose Father is interested in buying the Island, are deciding what to do when a group of vicious genetically altered Baboons kill the pilot. Kelsey & Deutsch just sort of run away. Our heavily armed group of rescuers, lead by Brodie, arrive on the Island via boat. Scott feels Brodie is withholding some information but they troop on regardless of all the human & animal skulls they find. They find Kelsey & Deutsch but they are all attacked by the genetic Baboons. The Baboons now know they\\'re on the Island & will stop at nothing to kill the intruders as Brodie has to use his experience & firepower to keep everyone alive, with varying degrees of success. If that wasn\\'t enough the guy (Bruno Danza) driving the boat has buggered off leaving them stranded & the Baboons have killed Kovacs & destroyed the radio equipment. As the survivors run low on ammo & morale they decide to fight back against the Baboons!<br /><br />Directed by Nelson McCormick I thought Primal Force was an OK time waster but nothing that overly impressed me. The script by Micheal Thoma is about as clichéd as you expect of this sort of low budget TV production. First the characters, there\\'s the moody, unshaven hero with personal demons to exorcise but turns out be be a throughly decent chap in the end, the clean cut hero, the computer whizz, the tough female character, the token nobody who is there to die & nothing else just so something happens & the character who has other more mysterious motives for being on the Island. The innocent plane crash victims aren\\'t any better with the young pretty girl who screams a lot & the annoying selfish fat guy who doesn\\'t care about anyone but himself. Then there\\'s the story, a group becomes stranded in an isolated location & can\\'t call for help, sound familiar? Group encounter living threat that wants to kill them all for no real reason at all, group run low on ammo even though they never actually run out & have to come up with other ways to defeat their enemy in a nail-biting (not) climax, been done yeah? Genetic experiments gone wrong. One character who gets abducted by the enemy & is not killed for some unexplained reason unlike everyone else who are killed on sight. You probably get the message. Having said all that for what it is I thought Primal Force was OK & rolled out the clichés with a certain degree of entertainment value. Ron Pearlman as the muscle bound, wise cracking Brodie is great & almost makes Primal Force worth watching on his own, everyone else is utterly forgettable. Unfortunately one area where Primal Force loses a couple of stars is in the violence department, basically it hasn\\'t got any. This was obviously made with a fairly young teenage audience in mind as the blood, gore & nastiness is kept to an absolute minimum. The killer Baboons are just people in monkey suits, nothing particularly spectacular. Technically Primal Force is OK, it\\'s very MTV in style with quick cuts, jerky hand held camera movements during the attacks, slow motion, bleached colours & every other flashy pointless trick you can think of. On the plus side the Mexican locations on occasion look stunning & a few nice shots here & there captures it well. Overall Primal Force isn\\'t particularly good, but it ain\\'t particularly bad either just sort of average & I think a decent helping of blood & gore would have helped no end to improve it!\"'],\n",

       "  '\"A great story that should have been a great movie. It\\'s unfortunately pretty poorly directed, and the writing could have been tighter. I can still appreciate it for what it is, and hopefully writer/director Nichols, whose debut this is, will come up with something as good in the future and do better by it. Michael Shannon, Douglas Ligon and Barlow Jacobs play three men named Son, Boy and Kid. Their father left them when they were kids, which led to their mother abandoning them emotionally. Son, the oldest, basically raised them, and their lives are pretty lousy, though seemingly normal for the setting, rural Arkansas. When they hear their father has died, the three men attend his funeral and speak badly of the man who couldn\\'t have cared less about them. This deeply offends the old man\\'s second family, consisting of four brothers, and a war begins between them. What the film really has going for it is the great characterizations, very well performed by mostly amateurs. I pegged Michael Shannon last year, with his performances in Bug and Before the Devil Knows You\\'re Dead, as being one of this generation\\'s finest actors, and he does well by that promise here. Nichols almost undoes it all with awkward pacing and way too much wallowing in the town\\'s redneckiness. The film is mostly pitched as a serious indie with copious comic moments, all involving how trashy everyone is. The movie probably does not play well in the South. I think maybe the script\\'s biggest problem is that it really contains only one idea, and Nichols doesn\\'t want to spend it all in one place.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"LEO is the kind of film few people will have heard of--and that your local video store dealer will try to get you to rent because he knows nothing about it, either, and wants you to check it out for him. That\\'s what happened to me, at least. And with a cast this interesting, why not? Let me tell you why not. This is a very ambitious attempt to deal with themes of identity, child abuse, guilt, redemption and acceptance (all wrapped around James Joyce and his Ulysses, for Christ sake!)--with almost none of the requisite writing or directing talent to back up all that ambition. The director appears to have relied upon his good cast, who undoubtedly came aboard due to the ambitious script. But acting talent can only go so far; here, it stops well short of productivity. Elizabeth Shue is particularly wasted--emoting to beat the band in a role that is one-note (well, one-and-one-half) and tiresome. A young actor named Davis Sweatt does wonders with the main character as an adolescent, and Joseph Fiennes is fine, too. Deborah Kara Unger gets abused again (she\\'s got to stop this sort of thing), Dennis Hopper is his usual nut case, and Sam Shepard\\'s laconic and macho. By film\\'s end, almost anything good has fallen away and what is left seems like pure pretension. It\\'s rare to see so much possibility come to so little.\"'],\n",

Because this one takes place in a beach, on a Summer day, it gives the impression of being a «Summer blockbuster».

Next, Jerry throws a couple of eggs to Tom\\'s eyes. Tom\\'s eyes sure look funny with those eggs and some \\\\\"decorations\\\\\" - lol.<br /><br />However, the most hilarious moments of this short are when Tom drinks sand instead of sugar in the coffee.

       "  '\"Next to Erik Van Looy, Dominique Deruddere may well be our, at least internationally, best known director. With his \\\\\"Iedereen beroemd\\\\\" or \\\\\"Everybody Famous\\\\\" as it is called in English, he was even nominated for an Oscar in the category \\'Best Foreign Language Film\\'. Personally I haven\\'t seen that movie yet, but I liked \\\\\"Hombres complicados\\\\\", the movie that he made before \\\\\"Everybody Famous\\\\\", a lot. Since then I\\'ve decided that I\\'ll try to see all his other movies as well and this \\\\\"Crazy Love\\\\\" is the first step into the right direction.<br /><br />The story of this movie has been divided into three time periods. The first period is situated in the 1950\\'s, when Harry Vos is still a young kid. He\\'s already very interested in everything that has got something to do with love and sexual relationships, but doesn\\'t really know anything about it. An older friend learns him everything there is to know about how to approach a girl and what to do when his method doesn\\'t work. But in all his naivety, Harry finds it very hard to understand that the romantic world which he knows from the movies, doesn\\'t exist in real life. To him the real world is an awful place. In the second part of the movie, we are in the 1960\\'s. Harry has grown up into an intelligent adolescent, but he has one mayor problem. He suffers from an incredibly extreme form of acne, which makes that all people stare at him, that the boys laugh at him, that the girls don\\'t want him and that he is afraid to appear in public. That\\'s also the reason why he still hasn\\'t experienced physical love. Even though he still has one close friend who supports him as much as he can, Harry slowly becomes a bitter, introvert and pessimistic person. In the third part, situated in the 1970\\'s we see him again. This time he is a drunk who is unable to express his feelings towards anybody. When he meets an old friend and they leave a bar, they do something incredible. As as joke, they steal a corpse out of a motor hearse that is parked in front of a hospital and take it home with them. When they open the body bag, they see that this dead body isn\\'t an old man or woman, but a young and very beautiful girl. Harry is so overcome by her beauty that he does the worst thing he could do with the body...<br /><br />In my opinion this movie was a bit of a slow starter and the first part (the 1950\\'s) didn\\'t always do it for me. Somehow I had the feeling that the story in that part could be developed better. But that \\'problem\\' was easily overcome by the second and the third part. When you see in the second part how he suffers from his acne, you can only feel very sorry for him. And then he comes up with that excellent idea which allows him to dance with the girl of his dreams. That part was absolutely brilliant, funny and sad at the same time and I don\\'t think that it will leave anybody untouched. The same about the third part, although this story is something completely different from the second. When I saw them steal that corpse, I had to laugh with it, but was disgusted by their behavior at the same time. And when you know that he has committed necrophilia, those feelings of disgust only increase. But than the director counters those feelings perfectly by letting him step into the sea, to disappear forever with the dead girl in his arms. Somehow that is a slap in your face and so touching at the same time. Really very strange.<br /><br />If you are interested in \\'foreign\\' cinema (I mean non-Hollywood movies, because for us Belgians this isn\\'t foreign of course), than you should definitely give this one a try. This isn\\'t the kind of movie that will offer you some big explosions or car chases, but the emotional roller-coaster that it puts you on, the intriguing story and the good acting, will definitely do the trick. Belgium may not be known for its many quality movies, but this one certainly can stand a comparison with other European movies. I give it a 7.5/10.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"During the late 1940s and early 1950s musicals acquired a distinctly noir-ish quality, and the life of singer Ruth Etting was made to order.<br /><br />Born in 1896, Etting was a hardknocks chorus girl when she caught the eye of small-time Chicago hood Martin \\\\\"Moe the Gimp\\\\\" Snyder, who married her in 1922 and proceeded to promote her career--occasionally, according to rumor, at gun point. By 1927 Etting was a popular singer and a major Broadway star, and when talkies arrived the couple moved to California, where Etting became a favorite for the musical shorts that were then in vogue. But the marriage was volatile, and when Snyder found Etting was having an affair with pianist Myrl Alderman, Snyder shot him. Alderman survived and Etting wasted little time in divorcing Snyder and marrying Alderman, but the scandal was so shocking that it effectively ended her career. She died, largely forgotten, 1978.<br /><br />As you might expect, LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME plays fast and loose with the facts, presenting Etting as an innocent (she wasn\\'t) and Snyder as a major crime figure (he wasn\\'t); even so, it does seem to capture something elemental about both the era and the characters. Much of this is due to the on-screen chemistry between leads Doris Day and Jimmy Cagney, who spark and sizzle in a truly surprising way.<br /><br />It will not surprise viewers that Cagney plays Snyder extremely well; he is, after all, best recalled for his numerous crime-drama roles. But it may surprise viewers that Day had the acting chops to match him. Today she is most widely remembered as a master of light comedy, but in truth Doris Day\\'s films of the 1940s and 1950s were more often hard drama than fly-weight amusements, including such heavy-hitters as YOUNG MAN WITH A HORN, STORM WARNING, and YOUNG AT HEART; she would continue her string of dramatic roles in such films as Alfred Hitchcock\\'s THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH. Her performance in LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME is often considered her high-water mark as a dramatic actress: she gives it everything she\\'s got, and the sparks really fly when she and Cagney square off.<br /><br />The look of the film, which was directed by Charles Vidor and sports art direction by the legendary Cedrick Gibbons, is beautiful, and the film moves at a smart clip; its one failing is that censorship issues of the era left several scenes--including a legendary rape sequence--on the cutting room floor. The music, drawn from Etting\\'s most famous recordings, is also memorable, and Day pulls out all the stops for her songs. The DVD is not flawless, but you\\'ll never notice it, and it includes several bonuses, two of which show us the real Ruth Etting. Recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer\"'],\n",

In the lame Altman film it stood for \\\\\"Oliver Cromwell\\\\\" Ogilvie. <br /><br />That is the whole problem with this movie. It should have been out of control fun, but it ends up as a lame reference to social significance. Altman tries to take a tried and true formula of a wacky teen sex comedy (a valid, wonderful and meaningful genre of American Cinema, just like film noir) and violates it by bringing in bad actors, crappy cinematography, and, worst of all, some sort of message of what this aged and senile director thinks is the problems of youth in Reagan era America.<br /><br />At least the previous NL effort, \\\\\"Vacation\\\\\" they had a good director (NL alumni Harold Ramis) satisfactory actors, and the story was fairly close to the original John Hughes piece. None of the actors here, (save Jon Cryer) are interesting, funny or even remotely close to the few characters brought over from the NL articles (they added other lame characters for no reason, such as OC\\'s grandfather, wasting the talents of Ray Walston). Not even the amazing sounds of King Sunny Ade can save this film (they are only in this film for a five minute cameo). What I cannot understand is that by 1984 when this film was made (it was so bad it was quietly released three years later), why did NL not give this film to a reliable director such as Harold Ramis, John Landis, Amy Heckerling, or John Hughes? <br /><br />All I can say is to look over the thirty some reviews of this movie and see how the lines are drawn. Those who loved this movie have never read (or had it read to them) the articles of OC & Stiggs that graced the pages of National Lampoon. Those who abhor this movie are those who can read and have enjoyed and lived their lives according to the gospel of OC & Stiggs as written in the brilliant National Lampoon articles. <br /><br />If you want the story of OC & Stiggs, read the original articles, they\\'re on the net and should be required reading in all schools, churches and drinking establishments. If you want to see a funny teen sex comedy, rent classics \\\\\"American Pie,\\\\\" \\\\\"Porky\\'s\\\\\" or \\\\\"Private Resort.\\\\\" If you want to see and here King Sunny Ade and his infectious ju-ju sound, rent \\\\\"Konkombe\\\\\" or buy \\\\\"Roots of Rhythm,\\\\\" you will not be sorry.

Unfortunately, she\\'s wasted here with little to do. We get the Tin Lizzie driven by George Hayes, also featured in \\'Texas Terror.\\' Note: In this film he sings a song!

       "  '\"Takashi Miike makes a samurai movie as a western. The Japanese cast speaks in English, the music is eclectic with strong spaghetti western influences, and the material is referential and full of homage and send up.<br /><br />It begins with a Quentin Tarantino cameo, then switches to the story of two clans fighting over the supposed treasure in a small town. Into the stand off rides a stranger with no name.<br /><br />Forgive the brevity, but if you\\'ve seen any number of spaghetti westerns then you\\'ve probably seen something like this story that spins out here. The tale of gold lust and warring factions isn\\'t anything new. What is new is how Miike dresses it up. Clearly the Japanese could make a western if the wanted to. Its a clever re-imagining of the genre and is interesting enough to warrant at least a brief look see.<br /><br />The problem with the film is that its 30 to 45 minutes too long. A very good first half hour gives way to long exposition in the middle hour, and while there are some genuinely nice moments its a little too plodding as it tries to cover one cliché too many. The film then picks up in the final 40 minutes with a huge shoot out. Its a schizo movie at times as things just go on and on. However when the film works- which it does at the ends and for a chunk of the middle, this is some of the best film making I\\'ve seen this year so far. The characters, the action, some set pieces are simply stunning, not to mention touching, there are several moments of real emotion.<br /><br />And make no mistake, this is a spaghetti western, and the film is a bit more fun if you know the genre. For example the Django in the title will alert anyone who\\'s seen the Franco Nero film of Django what is inside the coffin that is dragged around. You don\\'t need the know the genre but it will help you identify what they are stealing from.<br /><br />7 out of 10 for the mixed up and down nature of the film.<br /><br />Probably the only one who could have pulled this off was Miike and he did it wonderfully.\"'],\n",

This being said, \\\\\"Matador\\\\\" is better than all of them!! \\\\\"Matador\\\\\" belongs up there among the best TV-series EVER produced in the world, in my opinion. Starting in the 1920s (I believe) we get to follow the people in the small Danish town of Korsbaek, particularly the families Varnaes and Andersen-Skjern (who are constantly at odds with each other) up to the 1950s. This is an important period in the Danish - and Scandinavian - history (with the 2nd Worl War; the occupation of Denmark) and even though I\\'m not Danish I really enjoy learning more about Denmarks national and local history in this way as well. The gallery of all colorful characters (played by the greatest Danish actors of the time) really is what makes this story and TV-series work. They all have their individual story and a dept; no one is one-dimensional. You really care about these people and want to see what happens with them.<br /><br />I grew up with this series through my teenage years as it was shown at Swedish TV4 daily during the afternoons when I got home from school, and I became totally addicted to it. =) My favorite character in the whole series - and the heroine I root for - is Elisabeth (played by Helle Virkner), although her neurotic/hysteric/weepy sister Maud (Malene Schwarz) is kind of priceless too! ;) (and that\\'s why Elisabeth is my heroine; for putting up with her!! and *spoiler- spoiler - spoiler* why, oh why, didn\\'t she marry Dr. Hansen - he is just so cute! - and SO in love with her.. ;) Ah, well... Kristen is cute too, I suppose... =P) <br /><br />Except for being a great historical mirror of these decades, this series more so shows what gossip, narrow-mindedness, intrigues, too much money, family pride and man-egos =) do to people and what effect it has on friends and family in a brilliant way... especially between the banker Varnaes and the store manager Andersen-Skjern. Because underneath it all you really feel and sense that these two families, especially the central male characters of Mads Skjern and Hans Christian Varnaes, really could be best friends and really would have like each other if things had been a bit different... it\\'s really both ridiculous and sad.

She, the cool-headed savvy- tough-and-sexy moll, is almost on top of things enough to redeem the situation but not quite. The key elements of the underworld ruling coalition-- dirty councilor and policeman, lieutenants of varying backgrounds both tough and educated-- make you believe in how this man has achieved peace through strength.<br /><br />The film\\'s plot is Byzantine whodunit, with gangland-style violence as an accent piece that seems downright tame in the age of \\\\\"Pulp Fiction\\\\\".

The views from boating on the Thames are unrecognizable to those who have only seen modern London--- the sole landmarks in common are Tower Bridge and the Savoy hotel.

A bunch of teenagers rent the house next door for a night of debauchery. Jason Voorhees, being a slasher, wasn\\'t adequately killed last time, so he gets to come back now.

It doesn\\'t mention the meat of the plot which involves the humans being used in experiment in copulation by some mysterious (and horny) aliens. If it had I mightn\\'t watched it not having acquired a taste for having my sci-fi b-movies spliced with soft core pornography. The presence of real actors such as Robert Englund and Adam Baldwin here is a little surprising- okay, they\\'re not hugely respected actors or stars and generally appear in B-movies but I would have though they were both above soft core porn like this.<br /><br />Basically 70% of the movie consists of soft core porn scenes or stock footage from other sci-fi and action movies clumsily reinserted into the movie with some pitiful attempts to fit in to the narrative. I didn\\'t realise to now Roger Croamn was involved. The opening 5 minutes of the movie is a compilation of snippets from different movies clumsily spliced together with a bit of voice over narration- a mixture of space battles, some contemporary war stuff, strip club sequences and what looked like some kind of genetic experimentation and surgery footage. I\\'m not sure but I think this was meant to indicate the breakdown of civilisation on earth as we know it and/or be the nightmares of the main characters. It is really hard to tell. Later on there is a lengthy space battle that clearly came from a different movie awkwardly stuck into the movie in between sex scenes and more of the same footage from the introduction used when the aliens are giving a lecture of the downfall of humanity (Which is awfully preachy for a movie like this). Each of the characters is given an introduction which seems to consist of snippets from other movies the actor/actresses were in- one guy was clearly in a few Kick-boxing movies.<br /><br />Basically a bunch of humans, consisting of scientists, soldiers and exotic dancers, wake up on this space ship with no idea of how they got there. They soon meet some aliens, who have taken the form of humans, lead by Robert Englund who is pretending to be a priest of some sort, who corral them into a breeding experiment, which is basically an excuse for a whole lot of sex. The ostensible reason of this initially is to rebuild the human race but with only 8 people that is going to be one limited gene pool. It is later revealed that the aliens have some plan which involves interbreeding with the humans, I forget why. There is a confused subplot about a faction of the alien dudes wanting to stop the experiment to maintain genetic purity. It makes less sense than you might think as the only alien seen to get down and dirty with the humans is the one who wants to kill them all because her faction is opposed to the interbreeding thing. There is one head scratching scene with her and Englund, the only two aliens onboard the ship at this point- the other having been randomly killed by an android (Don\\'t ask), in which he explains how he thinks one of them must be from the rival faction but doesn\\'t seem to come to the logical conclusion. Given he presumably knows he isn\\'t the guilty party himself it leaves him with a suspect pool of one and he is warning her he knows. I\\'m generously presuming this is maybe meant to be a warning on the part of Englund to alien chick to quit it already rather than the writers for this thing being the dumbest people ever (It brings to mind Danny De Vito\\'s attempt to write a two character murder mystery in Don\\'t Throw Momma From the Train). Anyway, there is a whole bunch of screwing, most of the characters die and there are some really bad make effects for the alien transformations and killings- I was starting to fall asleep toward the end of the movie so my memories of the conclusion I kind of hazy.<br /><br />There one or two weird bits of note relating to the alien tech on the ship. You only have to mention what food you want to eat and a plate of that food will instantly appear in your hand. There is a scene in which Robert Englund orders a plate of meatloaf and mashed potato \\'the way his mother made it\\' and gets it right down to the amount of garlic his mother put in the spuds. Other than this one godlike piece of technology none of the rest of the equipment the aliens use is quite as impressive- they can instantly create matter based on the sensory memories in someone\\'s head but only if it is in the form of food. Strangely enough nobody else is seen to take advantage of this wonderful device- I guess they were all to busy screwing. The other strange device are these lasers that pop out of the ceiling the second that anyone dies and burn the corpse to dust (Leaving the clothing). Why, I\\'m not sure. I\\'m also not sure why if they have sensors and weaponry that sophisticated they don\\'t just use it as a security system.<br /><br />Basically, unless you want to see some generic soft core porn involving Adam Baldwin intercut with shots of a leering Robert Englund or you\\'re some kind of sick, sick masochist stay away.\"'],\n",

He was one of those who left the dead model\\'s body left in a tub with running water(..the image of this dead model is displayed quickly before every murder scene takes place with the director letting the viewer know that this is the motivation behind the stabbings). The stabbings themselves are often gushing wounds, but the final attacks show the aftermath of a castration and breast removal, pretty potent, shocking stuff. There\\'s even some sad humor portraying Gisele\\'s portly husband(..who is quite a danger driving on the roads of Milan with director Bianchi\\'s camera following with a POV shot of the car passing through endless traffic, red lights, and even threatening civilians walking on the streets)as a clown in heat who can not deliver in the clutch. Nice job by Blue Underground bringing giallo fans a print of true quality and the film looks great..with good use of color and sound photography, Bianchi really provides the film with style. Yet, this isn\\'t particularly any different than the endless chain of gialli circling the market, so to combat this Bianchi put naked flesh across the screen almost through the film\\'s entirety. This giallo does have your typical wacky twist revealing why this killer is so viciously killing his/her victims, but this time, the revelation might be underwhelming considering it\\'s a person who isn\\'t as significantly drawn as other characters in the plot. This is indeed a true treat for those with an appreciation for smut. Film suffers for not having a likable character to root for, but Fenech once again portrays the endangered character in pursuit(..and being pursued)of the killer.\"'],\n",

Miss PIckford also plays the lads mother incorporating techniques quite clever for its day. Tricks like forced perspective, over-sized sets, and double exposures that reportedly took many hours to film to get it right. The sentimental story\\'s acting is superb all around and encompasses quite a bit of humor as well as drama. The sets are very good and it\\'s amazing how Miss Pickford acts a bit naive like a young boy would but full of genuine heart and compassion for others. Claude Gillingwater is excellent as the cantankerous Earl who sends for the American boy who he had disowned because his late son had married a American commoner. Also excellent is Joseph Dowling as the Earl\\'s lawyer who handles his affairs including being the bearer of bad news. The film has been restored by the Mary Pickford Foundation and a very nice orchestra soundtrack was added in recent years. It all adds up to a timeless movie fill of charm and it\\'s easy to see why Mary Pickford was a superstar in her time. Another note: She became so popular that she formed her own company and along with others like Charlie Chaplin was a founder of United Artist which is an organization of independent film companies.\"'],\n",

The portrayal of the future is hardly better than a shot of a present day main-street strip.

And the result is excellent. This riveting human drama by Jacques Audiard features an impressive performance by Romain Duris as Tom, a 28 year-old hoodlum who seems destined to follow in his father\\'s footsteps as a property shark working in a sleazy, barely legal twilight zone of the dodgy Parisian real-estate world. But a chance encounter with a former music teacher leads him to believe that he can become, like his mother, a concert pianist. With the help of a young virtuoso pianist, who just arrived from China, he starts preparing for a crucial audition, but soon the pressures from his former pals mount and he gets trapped between two opposite worlds. But Tom is not just a sensible artistic young man desperately trying to escape the world he lives in. He\\'s not entirely sure he wants to leave his old life behind him. He\\'s got a mean streak and when necessary, he takes care of some unresolved matters using whatever means he deems appropriate to take care of unwilling partners, squatters or whoever gets in the way of his (or his father\\'s business interests), really putting the squeeze on people unwilling to cooperate. <br /><br />Romain Duris injects his role with an enormous amount of vibrancy and energy. I\\'ve never seen Duris in another role before, but his character is complex, perennially nervous, strained, angry, but incredibly charming. One moment he\\'s in leather jacket, wiping the blood of his face after a little bashing with some squatters. The next, he\\'s in suit and tie and negotiates with real-estate moguls. The film\\'s atmosphere is dark, moody and downbeat, but Tom\\'s vibrant energy and aggression firmly keeps the viewer\\'s attention. Jacques Audiard\\'s direction is remarkable assured. He seems to know exactly what he wants to present on the screen, never showy and a keen camera eye to give the already top-notch performances maximum impact. What\\'s so refreshing, is that the film doesn\\'t make a big point out of the human relationships.

       "  '\"Home Alone took everyone by surprise when it became the top money-earner of 1990. Director Chris Columbus, writer/producer John Hughes and most of the cast and production staff reunited two years later for this sequel, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York. But the cynic in one has to ask, did we really need a sequel to Home Alone?<br /><br />It feels like everyone has returned because they knew they had a sure-fire hit on their hands rather than any pressing concern to continue this story arc. This was Chris Columbus\\' first time directing a sequel, and as expected, he falls into the exact same trap that cripples many a sequel. He fails to do anything different with it.<br /><br />It may have traded in being left at home for the city of New York, but its still the same exact story as last time. Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin, obnoxious as ever) is separated from his family at Christmas. He enjoys the freedom to do whatever he wants. Until things turn sour. The burglars are back, and just happen to be in New York as well. He sets up another mine field of home-made booby traps for them. The lonely snow-shoveller from Pt 1 has been replaced with a lonely pigeon lady. She rescues him. He gets reunited with his family.<br /><br />Home Alone 2 feels like a much more calculated attempt to recreate the successful elements of Home Alone. The first was not quite a holiday classic, but it was reasonably successful. Due to John Hughes\\' fine screenplay rather than anything on Columbus\\' part. Pt 2 sticks to the formula laid out by Pt 1 with an almost alarming reverence.<br /><br />It ticks off each situation like a check-list. And I\\'m afraid the fault for that lies with John Hughes. His script has none of the tiny amusements or sharp insights that propelled the first film. He\\'s just copied his own screenplay, and grafted it onto a new setting. I think it was around this point that John Hughes sold himself out to Hollywood. Nowadays he only churns out increasingly formulaic fluff. Merely the same concept with whole different actors.<br /><br />Chris Columbus has also borrowed an idea or two from his debut feature, Adventures in Babysitting. The story of four kids lost on the streets of Chicago one night. That film always seemed like a missed opportunity to me. Chris Columbus is far too bland as a filmmaker. He played the whole situation too safely, and never really got the best out of it. In fact when I first saw it, I thought if it had been made by John Hughes, it could have been a much better film. I was hoping for that with Home Alone 2, but unfortunately I didn\\'t get it.<br /><br />This is an even greater disappointment. Columbus\\' blandness coupled with Hughes\\' lack of imagination all adds up to a very boring film. Home Alone 2 never really ignites. It misses the natural warmth and amusing developments of the first film by a mile. There is something almost mechanical to it all. Like watching different plot points clicking into place at exact moments. But the one thing that really works against the film is Macaulay Culkin.<br /><br />Home Alone got a lot of mileage from young Kevin\\'s innocent, wide-eyed view of his predicament. By this point, that innocence has all but gone. Culkin\\'s precocity has completely taken over, and now he\\'s just an obnoxious brat we couldn\\'t care less about. Its impossible to feel for his plight because he\\'s so unlikable. And having him mouth inane sentiments in a shallow attempt to make him seem wise only irritates. They lack any conviction and hollows out an already empty film.<br /><br />We do get a few amusements from some of the new members of the cast. Tim Curry gets a few laughs as the manager of the Plaza Hotel. In a performance seemingly modelled on Basil Fawlty, his growing suspicion of Kevin is pretty funny, even if he\\'s a bit stupid to be suckered in by Kevin\\'s tricks. And Dana Ivey and Rob Schneider fill out the cast nicely as the equally suspicious (and equally stupid) hotel staff.<br /><br />But nothing else works. There are times when Home Alone 2 thinks its being really clever, by dropping in knowing references to the first film, in a vain attempt to make you think this is not a rehash. But it is. And its not above reusing the same gags either. We even get another film that Kevin uses to dupe people with. Which also happens to be a sequel. You can almost imagine Chris Columbus and John Hughes patting themselves on the backs at times like that.<br /><br />Of course what people come to see the movie for is Harry and Marv (Joe Pesci & Daniel Stern) going through another of Kevin\\'s obstacle courses. But where it proved to be the comic high point of the first film, Chris Columbus has blown it up to absurd proportions for this one. The traps in Pt 1 were at least kept within the boundaries of plausibility, but sadly Columbus has thrown all that out the window. Its amazing they\\'re still breathing, much less walking after the things they go through this time. They even fall off the top of a building with no apparent after effects. Its at this point you realise you\\'re watching the live-action equivalent of a Looney Tunes cartoon. Only not as funny.<br /><br />I don\\'t even want to talk about the improbable, contrived happy ending. Home Alone 2 is a real stinker. Its never as funny as it likes to think it is, or as warm either. Its just a pointless sequel that only reveals a blatant calculation at the heart of the enterprise. Another bland film from the drab Chris Columbus, and the start of the sad decline of John Hughes\\' once proud career.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"Turner Classic Movies showed this silent, B&W flick today (Aug 29, 2007) on TV.<br /><br />Solid classic adventure story, complete with all of the key ingredients: exotic plot locations, a beautiful woman in peril, a pair of dauntless and resourceful heroes (one of them handsome, the other colorful) grossly outnumbered by badguys, sprinkled with comic relief. Great costumes and sets; as good or better than those of current movies. Surprising variety of camera craft and directorship; pans and zooms including overhead angles, and closeups of key characters and objects. In this regard again it seems like a modern movie! Actions convey the story very well; without the benefit of a soundtrack. Of course, this entails a considerable degree of live type acting (similar to that seen in plays), but I did not get a feeling of melodrama like is all too common in most silent films and early sound movies.<br /><br />The most enjoyable performance is played by Louis Wolheim as the rough edged but colorful Sgt. Peter O\\'Gaffney, who was *perfectly* casted for the role; considering both appearance and skill.<br /><br />There were at least a few peculiar facts about Muslim society that I had previously learned over the past several years, which added to my appreciation of the story in the area of historical accuracy.<br /><br />My favorite scene was when the heroes are fleeing a swarm of dangerous, sword wielding Arabs through the narrow streets of a busy Muslim city. Suddenly though the chase is interrupted by an oblivious imam who pops out onto an exterior balcony to announce that it\\'s time for afternoon prayer. Everyone out on the streets (except for the heroes) religiously obeys Islamic law and momentarily kneels down, which allows the heroes to escape. That scene was just one example of the film\\'s many expressions of originality.<br /><br />After seeing this movie I better realize how extensively modern movies contain rehashed ideas that were pioneered decades earlier.\"'],\n",

The basic idea of this show tanked in other countries where the people are more intelligent but somehow, five years after the rank original, the people of Britain still buy into this crap. They still fall for the same old, same old rubbish that was boring first time around. It boggles the mind. Are we really all that stupid? I blame the Sun newspaper.<br /><br />Big Brother is a wasteland of coma-inducing boredom consistently starring a deliberately PC and multi-ethnic group of people (with an absolute MAX of 1 token Scottish person) with no personality outside of the stereotyped image they were \\'cast\\' to present.

Thus nullifying any genuine sense of \\'reality\\' TV. <br /><br />Every Friday night is \\'eviction night\\' in which the people of this once mighty and powerful land spend money phoning in who they want evicted from the house (and trust me, Channel 4 REALLY likes it when you phone many times in one night \\'just to make sure\\'). That fame-grabbing, wannabe, desperate individual then begins their definite, inevitable, inexorable descent into well deserved obscurity. Davina McCall, who apparently has nothing better to do with her life as she\\'s \\'hosted\\' this mince since the very beginning, interviews that person with eyes and attitude that loudly suggest \\'Who the hell are you and why are you taking up so much airtime?\\' before showing them the mandatory and expected \\'best of\\' their bits scene.

I am proud to say that I fall into this category, as does Richard Pryor\\'s character Joe Braxton in this film. He plays a foul-mouthed, ill-mannered ex-con, who is, let\\'s face it, a bum. For some reason, though, he is likable. Maybe it\\'s because he still has an optimistic outlook about his life. His biggest strength, which almost proves to be his undoing, is that he is willing to do more for others than he is for himself. This is what I felt made \\\\\"Bustin\\' Loose\\\\\" such a touching movie.<br /><br />Joe Braxton is a parolee who has been given a second chance to rebuild his life. His only problem is, he can\\'t really seem to find a purpose on the outside, and just doesn\\'t know how to make it. In a hilarious courtroom scene where he is about to be sent back to prison for larceny, in violation of his parole, he is given ten years probation by the judge.<br /><br />His parole officer, however, is amused, but not at all fooled by the courtroom shenanigans. So, as a favor, his parole officers needs a favor. A group of disadvantaged Philadelphia youths have had their school closed as a result of budget cuts. Cicely Tyson, who portrays her character brilliantly, plays their supervisor who is also the girlfriend of Joe\\'s parole officer. She and the kids need to be driven across country to her family\\'s Washington state farm to start over. Joe is asked to drive the bus and return in 15 days.<br /><br />This is where the movie takes a wonderful turn for the better and gives some pleasant surprises. It could have been a silly Disney-like movie with cute, fake dialog that cuts corners and makes you want to throw up at the end (like Dead Poet\\'s Society). Instead of all that nonsense and garbage, we heard words of truth, and witness some convincing changes.<br /><br />At first, Joe sees this as a chore and the kids as nothing but a bunch of losers. Later though, he begins to bond with the kids and discovers, as does the kids, that he actually really does care about them because he doesn\\'t want what happened to him to happen to them. He finds a purpose, and a reason to be happy. He becomes a pleasant, and is actually a warm person after all who just needed the right people to bring out the goodness in him. Perhaps this is because his love for the kids makes him forget about his problems and worry about their well-being. <br /><br />There are some tough scenes, too. There is boy who has experienced a tragedy, not intentionally, but because of a problem he cannot help. Another one of the youths solicits prostitution to Joe. There are also about whether the kids will be able to keep their new home, or if Joe can actually make it on the outside. All of these scenes show reality and how people find the courage to deal with their own lives. Richard Pryor plays these scenes with a quiet, subtle brilliance. He is not just a funny comedian, he is also a good actor. <br /><br />The only flaw the movie has is that it seems to lack some little scenes to make Prior\\'s character develop his relationship and bond together with the kids and Cicely Tyson\\'s character. Don\\'t get me wrong, it\\'s usually better to keep an audience wanting more than to drag a movie out, but I think this one may have benefited from more running time. The transition from con to nice guy seemed just a little bit too quick, and I think this could have been the difference between making this a great movie instead of a good one. It\\'s as though the screenwriter didn\\'t sit down and rewrite quite thoroughly enough. That, however, is easily forgiven and forgotten. <br /><br />I will not give away what happens, I will say only this: I was pleasantly surprised because this movie wasn\\'t just a comedy. There are a lot of serious scenes, too, and the ending is very perceptive about human behavior. Bustin\\' Loose is not a masterpiece, but it is an entertaining, convincing movie, and it works because of the performances.

Some of the most disturbing footage was of violence by regional troops aligned with the government, which Director/Producer Phillipe Diaz revealed (during the Q & A after the screening at Slamdance Film Festival) had been given to him by a Sierra Leonian government official who wanted the truth revealed, although it clearly meant he had to flee his country forever. M. Diaz, who has faced a good deal of pressure not to show this film, and who himself cannot return to Sierra Leone or to Nigeria, had to disguise the true focus of the film he was making from the authorities as long as possible, finally handing over a set of \\'dummy\\' tapes and smuggling the real ones out of the country.\"'],\n",

They take their annual vacation un the south of France. The drama unfolds as they\\'re enjoying a beautiful summer\\'s day at a local beach. While Marie lies down to have a sunbake, Jean, after a reflective glance at the surf, rises, and heads into the surf for a swim. After dozing off, Marie wakes up to find that her husband is not lying beside her. She searches the beach and he is nowhere to be found. He has vanished, her nightmarish ordeal has begun. The best decription I can find for this film is that it charts the intense, oscillating experiences of one woman as she has to face the loss of her husband in a horrible way. Charlotte Rampling\\'s performance as Maris is strong. The whole gamut of experiences are revealed.

       "  '\"Claude Chabrol, the French director of many thrillers and dramas and other genres, is at his best when subtly but forcefully pulling the rug out from the viewer. This isn\\'t your usual case of a romance story criss-crossed with a serial killer thriller. In fact, we\\'re not made very much aware that there is a serial killer- save for a few mentions here and there- until halfway through the movie, and by the time we are it\\'s full-throttle in a kind of expertly manipulated suspense, not in the usual sense but through an ominous musical score by Pierre Jansen and a movement of fluidity with the camera that tells the story sort of conventionally but not at the same time. It\\'s a small, master\\'s class in subverting the genre by making us care so much about the characters even as we know they\\'re doomed from the happy opening.<br /><br />That\\'s not to say that Chabrol has made anything that can\\'t be enjoyed by one looking for a good entertaining thriller first and foremost. If anything the opening of the movie is what lures one in perfectly, as it\\'s a very jovial in this wedding sequence one sees guests school-teacher Helene (Stephane Audran, Chabrol regular) and butcher Paul (Jean Yanne, perfect as the butcher), enjoying themselves and making good conversation. This stretches out into the first half of the film; a friendship develops around food that Paul brings over, and it\\'s only when Paul thinks its time to go the \\'next step\\' that he\\'s told it can\\'t be because of a past horrible relationship that Helen faced- horrible in the sense of disappointment. There\\'s a disconnect emotionally that is left open, thus, going into the second half of the film, where finally we see what some of us would be waiting for: the serial killer plot.<br /><br />There\\'s a string of murders involving women, and one of them- the bride from the opening- is a shocker not exactly for the revelation itself, per-say, but how Chabrol builds up to it. At first it\\'s seen as the most suspenseful thing in the film so far as Helen leads her class along a mountainside and stops to have lunch. The music is playing right here, and it\\'s really chilling for how simple it lays out the tension, like a weirdo standing across the street in a black cloak acting suspicious but, at the same time, too subtle to pin down. This adds to the sudden shock, then, after the music stops and finally the reveal happens via blood dripping on the kid\\'s sandwich. This, however, is just one example of Chabrol\\'s calm mastery as a director of the material.<br /><br />It would be one thing to go on and on about the eerie absorption of the camera-work, which goes between conventional stylization (for a French film of the period) and poetic editing and framing. Or to go on and on about the stunning work turned by Audran (going between an entire emotional palette, as it were, from happy to sobbing to frightened to pale and shot to hell) and Yanne (also great at what he\\'s meant to be, our male protagonist and, sadly, eventual antagonist by default). But it\\'s the emotional struggle that makes this compelling above all other good reasons to recommend.<br /><br />The Butcher posits a relationship that is platonic, naturalistic, and genuinely interesting; these aren\\'t cookie-cutter characters but well-drawn and with things that make them identifiable even as they, early on, seem to go on about trivial things not related to the plot (a little like a Woody Allen movie). Then, when it switches gears bit by bit and the paranoia increases, by the time the climax comes it becomes very, ultimately, tragic. Chabrol goes to lengths to reveal, simply, the soul of a man one should not feel any sympathy for. That one close-up in the car ride to the hospital is one of the finest climaxes I might ever see in a movie from Europe, even anywhere. And damned if isn\\'t representative of what Chabrol can do as a craftier but no less true-to-his-art member of the Cashier du cinema filmmaker club. A+\"'],\n",

       "  '\"This film was recently recommended to me on a forum discussion concerning the best LGBT cinema. But Mauvais Genres is so good that I wouldn\\'t say that it appeals only to such interest groups. It is excessively Hitchcockian (an adjective used far too often, but utterly justified in this case) in it\\'s outlook. Indeed there are so many MacGuffins in this thriller involving props such as a microfilm or a heart-shaped box that you feel it edging almost into the territory of parody. As it is the movie stays at a more gleeful, vital, tone, revelling in homage. It is glossy enough for us to suggest that its tone comes from Hitchcock via de Palma. The music though seems directly inspired by such classic Hitchock scores as that in Vertigo.<br /><br />There are in my opinion two characters in this movie of outstanding interest. First we have Bo, a transsexual entertainer, played by Robinson Stévenin, in what has to be one of the most outstanding performances that I have ever seen (winning the Cesar for best new actor). She is such an alive and beautiful person that it is truly painful when we see her subjected to violence. There is a subplot in the film concerning the fact that she was abused as a child and there are implications that her retreat into femininity is a coping strategy for dealing with that abuse. I\\'m in no way qualified to examine the risibility or otherwise of such claims, but certainly these thoughts may have been filtering through her mind and leading towards self-destructive behaviour.<br /><br />The meat of the movie, which is only ostensibly a serial-killer thriller, is her love for Johnny, a clearly violent and handsome young man who has very mixed thoughts concerning transsexuals. Her love for him is so blind as to verge on self-immolation, her approaches undeterred by even a broken arm. I watch film to see excesses of emotions, and in her love for this psychotic individual, Bo\\'s love becomes a fiery inferno that inundates her.<br /><br />Johnny is also a very interesting character, he joined up in the foreign legion to see the tropics but, we are told, ended up waiting table at headquarters in Avignon.

However, she can\\'t take all of the blame for the poor fighting as the choreography was atrocious (people getting knocked out by being kicked in the leg?) and the multiple interrogations were intrinsically stupid (Chun Li asks question, bad guy resists, Chun Li punches bad guy and bends his arm funny, bad guys tells her everything \\x96 all in the course of ten seconds.) But when you put her together with Chris Klein, it creates a void of acting ability that would have made it impossible to buy into the plot if the plot were actually plausible. The only decent performances in the entire movie were by Neil McDonough as Bison and, surprisingly, Moon Bloodgood as a detective \\x96 but that\\'s made moot by the fact that the writer has apparently never heard actual humans converse before, so the dialogue wouldn\\'t be worth listening to even if it were delivered well.

Also, he wipes out other crime families to be able to do it and is doing it because he wants a better life for his daughter \\x96 if they hadn\\'t repeatedly called him the head of a criminal organization, I might\\'ve thought he was just a decent hardworking businessman/superhero.<br /><br />It seems the entire movie was just filler until they could put the inevitable final confrontation on screen. And when she threw a fireball in that final confrontation, it was probably the worst special effect ever seen in a big-budget movie.

You owe it to yourself to see SHM II prior to seeing HtD.<br /><br />I won\\'t spend a lot of time on the plot. Let me just say that, through a series of improbable and illogical events, the five female leads end up wearing virtually nothing as they are stalked through a closed office building one Saturday. Quite a few people die, though usually off-camera and unrealistically, and \\\\\"Orville Ketchum\\\\\" lives up to his reputation as one of the funnier and more-difficult-to-kill B-movie actors. (The scene where he staples a bandage to his abdomen is priceless.) One final observation...unlike many of the straight-to-video movies being churned out today, HtD actually has some decent production standards. Cheap, yes, but competent. The film has been correctly exposed and color-compensated. The audio levels and re-recording are quite acceptable. There are no artsy-fartsy camera angles or unnecessary CGI effects. It is simply a better-produced movie than most of the dreck out there today.<br /><br />And it is a hoot! Either you get it, or you don\\'t.

Shortly after his arrival in Manilla, a phone rings in his backpack. He answers it. A male voice tells him that his mother and sister are captives and will be killed if he (Adam) doesn\\'t cooperate. The voice proceeds to send Adam by bus, taxi, motorized tricycle, and on foot through an urban landscape of busy streets, cramped apartments, a squatters\\' camp, a bank, a cockfighting arena, and a church. Adam\\'s conversations with the voice cover murder, Islam, jihad, rebellion in Mindanao, and his family.<br /><br />Adam is commanded by the voice to engage in terrorist acts against innocent civilians in order to save his mother and sister. Moreover, the voice extorts Adam of money his deceased father had saved for him, his mother and sister. Like most persons in Adam\\'s situation, Adam is compelled by fear to save his mother and sister, and comply with the voice\\'s command. The movie is based on a TRUE story.<br /><br />Based on the story of the movie and common perceptions about current events, you may come to the conclusion that this movie deals with terrorism sponsored by Islamic extremists. The disturbing reality is that governments and, in particular, intelligence agencies, e.g. CIA, are the ONLY organizations so well-financed, methodical, callous and evil as to perpetrate such criminal acts. Ask yourself - How is the voice aware of Adam\\'s whereabouts at every juncture in the movie? How is the voice aware of the money left by Adam\\'s father to Adam? Why would the voice go ahead and torture Adam\\'s mother and sister? The answer is that organizations such as the CIA are terrorizing innocent individuals and families to foment division among people, to induce individuals (fearing harm to their own family members, and indeed fearing God) to commit crimes on behalf of these organizations even as they fully believe that it is an Islamic extremist group. More disturbing than this fact alone, they can actually cause an individual to hear voices within their own mind (even though the movie depicted the use of cell phones). Indeed, they have the technology to see from the eyes and hear from the ears of nearly every individual in the world born in a hospital.<br /><br />Let\\'s be clear about it: God is about LOVE, not HATE.

While Louis (Levino Jensen) is a volcano, and Leo (Kim Bodnia) is a Volcano to be - because of his feeling of entrapment by his girlfriends pregancy - they fight there inner feelings, they are hunted by them and suffer, they dismiss life itself for momentary outburts of violence. On the other side you have Lenny (Mads Mikkelsen) and Lea (Liv Corfixen), who are so alienated by an urban society, that they withdraw themselves into escapism - Lenny trough movies, Lea trough books. They dismiss life trough distance to themselves and others.

In \\\\\"Pusher\\\\\" they talked constantly, in \\\\\"Bleeder\\\\\" the express them selves through attitude and thought.

He finds he repulsive, and finds himself out of control with his surroundings. One night while visiting his cousins Louis nightclub, he witnesses a man getting shot, which becomes a catalyst for his downfall.

The single goal of this movie was to point out events that happened in the plot line of the original High Noon through stale and unbelievable situations, as much as possible, as to conceal its completely lack of meaningful dialog or purpose in general. As a standalone movie, it failed to have any semblance of an interesting plot. As a sequel, it completely rejected the motivations of the characters in the original movie, reducing the cinematic experience to, \\\\\"suffer through the terrible dialog for 5 minutes until a gunfight occurs\\\\\". If only a few words or a single phrase could convey how completely vacuous this movie is, then this review would definitely be paragraphs shorter and most likely contain a few expletives.<br /><br />Will Kane (the fake one, Lee Majors) comes back to Hadleyville with his not-as-hot-as-Grace-Kelley bride Amy Kane (Katherine Cannon) with the intent of setting up a small cattle farm, with some horses here, and some cows and bulls there. Lacking any explained or implied purpose or intent, three villains decide to come to town in a fashion that is strangely plagiarized (and far better executed) by the original High Noon. Ben Irons (David Carradine), the main outlaw, is hunted down by the new Marshal of the town (Michael Pataki) and his posse, setting in motion a not-so-epic struggle that could have easily been resolved by never making this film in the first place. In a strange twist of foundational beliefs, Kane decides to wield a gun whenever possible and shoot people to the tunes of the awfully compiled soundtrack. Jerry Jameson, the director, should have taken a second of his time to realize that he should have opted out of butchering the sequel to such a great movie and quit his dead-end job at the prestigious USA Film studios, if not only to spare his future audiences from torture that could possibly be used to extract valuable information from the inmates at Guantanamo bay. \\\\\"Tell us the truth or you will be forced to watch this movie!\\\\\" Usually movies rely on nuanced cinematography and great acting to create an interesting story that an audience would actually surrender some of their valuable time to watch. Apparently USA Studios went ahead and skipped this chapter in the book entitled \\\\\"how not to make a bomb of a movie\\\\\". The only way High Noon Pt. 2 could produce drama was by putting some poorly written, 80\\'s syn th music on top of the action. You know, the kind of music that makes you want to vomit and throw away that old Casio you have been storing in your closet for decades. Apparently mentioning important events in the previous High Noon was not enough to make this movie interesting, and dramatic \\\\\"DUN DUN DUNS\\\\\" and \\\\\"SHREEK SHREEKS\\\\\" needed to be added to jar the audience into submission. \\\\\"Oh no, please don\\'t do this to me,\\\\\" I kept screaming as the fake Kane plunged into dialog about \\\\\"how he needed to get back at the new marshal.\\\\\" My efforts to somehow use my shrieking voice to alter the soundtrack on the magnetic VHS tape were in vain, and I nearly suffered a few mortal wounds. Fortunately, I was able to return the movie to the Hollywood video drop-off box two hours after viewing it, saying my last \\\\\"thank you\\\\\" to the legacy of High Noon sell-out movies that need to be quickly forgotten. If you want more heartaches, try the 80\\'s remake of the original High Noon. I swear, the purple pill isn\\'t going to save you this time.<br /><br />Most of this review has contained ambiguous bad-mouthing that does not confront the terrible reality of the movie itself. I\\'ll fix that in the flick of a wand! Remember the original High Noon, where Will Kane was a reluctant hero who did the right thing and fought Miller to the death? Say goodbye. Kane takes part in a series of events that run contrary to his \\\\\"no violence unless absolutely necessary\\\\\" beliefs, shifting the movie from an allegory about political persecution into a poorly executed Western that completely relies on gunfighting to entertain the audience. Kane fights the new Marshal a number of times, shooting back and forth, never getting hit, utilizing almost every bankrupt Western movie convention known to humanity. Instead of leaving you with the message that you need to stand up for yourself when outside pressures become overwhelming, this film lets you know that violence is always the answer, even when it comes to deciding whether someone is innocent or not. Why ask questions if you can just shoot people? High Noon pt. 2 failed to live up to its own standards, and was so incredibly bad and unwatchable that it descended beyond the point of being \\\\\"so bad that its actually funny\\\\\" to become \\\\\"two hours of pain that will not be easily forgotten\\\\\". The specifics of the plot are not even worthy of discussion, because at best they were completely ripped from the original film, or taken straight from the journal of a screenwriter who has the same ability to tell stories as a veteran who can\\'t get over a war. \\\\\"One day, back in \\'Nam\\\\\" becomes \\\\\"One day, back in High Noon the original\\\\\". Please, do not see this film. If you happen to start a class action lawsuit against USA Studios for releasing it, please notify me so I can sign up my name along with as many fake names as I can possibly think of.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"If you\\'re looking for clear plot pay-offs, this is a movie for which you should probably wait on the DVD.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman\\'s flawless form adorns the prow of this doomed, but baroque ship of fools and nearly redeems it entirely by force of sheer elegance.<br /><br />As a soon-to-be-wed New York nabob of indistinguishable profession, she is confronted by a ten-year-old boy claiming to be the man who widowed her ten years earlier, reincarnated. But a former inlaw may have something to say about the husband\\'s reappearance, and her fiancé\\'s none too pleased either.<br /><br />This film may prove compelling to those in the audience who\\'ve suffered the untimely loss of a spouse, but we are given very little reason to care about either Kidman\\'s character or her would-be grade-school suitor. Indeed, her fiancé seems the most genuinely human character in the picture as he finally snaps under the weight of the sheer absurdity of the situation and takes the boy across his knee. The ethereal Kidman and the even more otherworldly boy -- played by Cameron Bright -- each seem somewhat malevolent and selfish. In a couple borderline irresponsible scenes they bathe together and exchange thoughts on the sexual dynamics their union might entail. Artsy!<br /><br />You might say the film is about duking it out with your lover\\'s past or coping with lost love and infidelity, but, in the end, if you\\'re like me, you are not going to care about these people no matter how hard you try. And in a character-driven film like this, that\\'s pretty much the whole ballgame.<br /><br />But the cinematography and pacing are brilliant. Also, as mentioned, you get to look at Nicole Kidman in full Elvis for a hundred minutes and there\\'s far worse ways to spend an evening.<br /><br />As I said, a decent rental for a dull evening some night, but don\\'t lay out the nine dollars.<br /><br />This movie review by Erik Gloor\"'],\n",

       "  '\"Of course, this film is legendary. The first, and as far as I can tell / hope the last, all-midget musical western. Anyone who is extremely p.c. will be obviously outraged by the concept and the film. And of course, many cult film fans will want to see it for being one of the most exploitive films there is. However, its really not too exciting.<br /><br />The problem is that once the novelty of the film wears off it becomes quite dull. It\\'s hilarious and jaw-dropping at first, making you wonder how the filmmakers got away with this. Midgets ride Shetland ponies and rope calves, and walk UNDER those swinging barroom doors. They sing in voices that are extremely annoying and shrill. As far as acting goes, well, you can guess the amount of skill that went into this production. With the possible exception of the legendary Billy Curtis, the \\\\\"actors\\\\\" seem to be sleepwalking through the whole thing reading off cue cards. Of course, no one watches these films for technical skill, but even on camp merits it isn\\'t great. The film is fun and funny for a while, but becomes incredibly tedious by the end.<br /><br />Cult / exploitation film fans may want to rent this film or buy it for their collection if only for the sheer shock value of it. However, its over-hyped in the extreme. If you are interested in 30s exploitation cinema, I\\'d recommend both \\\\\"Maniac\\\\\" and \\\\\"Reefer Madness\\\\\" over this one.

       "  '\"I used to hate Uwe Boll. Like really despise. His films were some of the worst I have ever paid to see with BloodRayne, Alone in the Dark and House of the Dead couldn\\'t even have all their score combined to get a full star out of this reviewer.<br /><br />As a person, Uwe Boll also repulsed me. In 2006 he challenged critics of his films to \\'put up or shut up\\' and get into the boxing ring with him to defend their critiques.<br /><br />But then, I had a revelation. Why was it that I adored the offerings of one Roger Corman all these years when his films and Boll\\'s are very similar in their results. Both filmmakers do their best with limited budgets and produce films that are so laughable that you can\\'t help but look beyond the production values to find the entertainment in their product. In short, Corman and Boll both produce films that are un-watchable alone, but when enjoyed with friends, while having beers and yelling Mystery Science Theatre type comments at the screen, they can be fairly amusing. Tunnel Rats fits right into his resume along with Postal and In the Name of the King.<br /><br />Tunnel Rats is set during the Vietnam War and puts a bunch of expendable US soldiers in a position where they have to hunt the Viet Cong by exploring and hunting them in the various underground tunnels they have built under the forest battlefield.<br /><br />The tunnels are tight and dark, which does give a sense of claustrophobia, but doesn\\'t give you a lot to look at on the screen. The lighting is so dense with nothing more than a flashlight to illuminate a scene that you find yourself straining at the screen. Let\\'s face it, Uwe Boll films can give anyone a headache without having to squint for 90 minutes.<br /><br />So the film is pretty straight forward. One by one they go into the tunnel when the ones that went in prior don\\'t come back out. And one by one they all face various deaths thanks to the assorted weapons at the hands of the Viet Cong which include knives, guns and a sharpened bamboo poll.<br /><br />Unlike most other Uwe Boll films, Tunnel Rats tries too hard to develop character amongst the actors in the platoon. Countless (endless!) minutes are spent learning about their backgrounds and their hopes and ambitions if they survive the craziness of the war.<br /><br />Unfortunately, character building is not Boll\\'s strongpoint. Not that I know what his strongpoint is, but just having a group of soldiers sit around and jibber jabber about the things we have heard in any and all other Vietnam films produced since Oliver Stone\\'s platoon induced yawns that were larger than the holes these soldiers were climbing down.<br /><br />There is some half descent violence. The bamboo stick through the neck was good and when the enemy circles in around the platoon in a wave of explosions and gunfire, there are some good dismemberments to keep you interested.<br /><br />But not enough.<br /><br />When it is over, if you watched it with others, I am sure that the comments uttered aloud during the screening will allow for some value. If you watched it alone, Boll owes you 90 minutes of your life back. Or at least a chance to take a swing at him in the boxing ring.<br /><br />www.killerreviews.com\"'],\n",

       "  '\"I loved this show when I was in high school. Hunter was a kick-ass, take-no-prisoners kind of cop, even in the first 3 seasons where only a few suspects were actually killed when confronted by Hunter & McCall. In the last few seasons more and more of the suspects Hunter tried to arrest for murder pulled weapons on him and ended up dead. That made it a little tiresome although I never tired of seeing Hunter confront criminals.<br /><br />The idiotic, bleeding-heart approach to law enforcement - especially the \\'warning-shot\\' policy issued by Hunter\\'s captain (Michael Cavanaugh) in the pilot episode - really annoyed me in the first two seasons. John Amos was somewhat likable as Hunter\\'s captain save for his hatred of Hunter\\'s methods and what seemed to be his personal mission to get rid of Hunter. The character of Sgt. Terwillegar (James Whitmore, Jr) was as dumb as they come; a blustering buffoon who appeared more suited to teaching at a university than as a homicide detective. Commander Cain (Arthur Rosenberg) was even more loathsome; he was a man who was a politician first and a policeman second. Captain Devane (the late Charles Hallahan) was probably the most likable of all of their superiors, though he was a strictly by-the-book cop. Some of Hunter\\'s earlier superiors reminded me of Dirty Harry\\'s superior, Captain Briggs (Bradford Dillman of \\'The Enforcer & \\'Sudden Impact\\') who was on a single-minded crusade to get rid of Harry.<br /><br />Most of the stories centered around Hunter & McCall\\'s cases - usually homicides; one episode that made my skin crawl was one that appeared in Season 2 where McCall is raped by the son or a foreign diplomat, who then insists his psychopathic son is a saint and shields his son from answering for his criminal behavior behind diplomatic immunity. That particular one made me sick. I am hoping that Seasons 3 & 4 will be released on DVD - these were the ones that I thought were the best times for the show. Captain Devane was in charge, Hunter & McCall were strictly working homicides, and there was no subplot about the nefarious plans of Hunter\\'s superiors to can him - except in a couple of episodes featuring Cmdr. Cain (Rosenberg).<br /><br />Bring on Seasons 3 & 4!!\"'],\n",

       "  '\"I started watching this movie when SyFy broadcast it a few years back, but couldn\\'t get past the scene where the guy\\'s intestines literally fell out of his stomach (not terribly realistic, but still a bit upsetting). However, my curiosity got the better of me, and I did sit through the whole thing when it was on a few weeks back. And it did not fail to disappoint.<br /><br />The story line of this particular offering has to do with a scientist, Dr. Levering (Michael Ironside)who has come up with a plan for tapping into geothermal energy to heat Manhattan much more cheaply than conventional methods. He has contacted city employee Neil Kavanaugh (Kevin McNulty), and the two of them are planning on franchising their method and becoming filthy rich. Unfortunately, instead of tapping into geothermal energy, Levering actually taps into real magma, which starts cropping up all over Manhattan, and wreaking all kinds of havoc. When a crew of employees, lead by Matt (Costas Mandylor), encounters some very suspicious, and deadly, conditions in the tunnels and aqueducts under the city, Kavanaugh covers up the real cause. Geological services comes in to investigate, and one of the investigators turns out to be Matt\\'s ex-wife, Susan (Alexandra Paul). She doesn\\'t believe Matt when he says he saw lava in the tunnels. However, as more suspicious, and deadly, events happen, she reconsiders. By this point, however, overzealous Agent Walters (Matthew Benedict) has come to investigate, and is convinced that terrorism is afoot. Can Matt and Susan manage to stop the volcano before it obliterates most of New York City? <br /><br />Like most disaster plots, this one\\'s full of holes. First off, our geothermal expert just didn\\'t seem to really know anything about geothermal energy. Second, the implication for most of the deaths in the tunnel was that somehow the water in the pipes had turned into sulfuric acid, although they don\\'t explicitly say so. However, it\\'s hard to believe that the water would have changed to sulfuric acid without coming into contact with the magma, and if that had happened there would have been a huge steam explosion which would have obliterated most of Manhattan anyway. Then there was the homeowner who opened the door of his house only to be engulfed by lava. Why didn\\'t he smell anything burning, or notice heat coming from the ground, and why would he open a door once he\\'d burned his hand on the handle? Dr. Levering is badly burned, and left unconscious when the volcano starts to erupt at the drilling site. How did he get out of there? And what exactly happened to him in the tunnels? Was he killed or merely knocked unconscious by the steam emitting from the bullet hole in the tunnel wall. And finally, throughout the movie, people are way to close to lava with no problems caused by the hear or the fumes. All in all, it\\'s a pretty poorly written script.<br /><br />There were some surprisingly decent actors in this movie. Michael Ironside does a pretty good job as the mad scientist, who just gets crazier and crazier as the movie goes along. Mandylor and Paul do okay with the material they\\'re given. Unfortunately, it\\'s just poorly written, and there\\'s only so much they can do with it. Sad to say, the rest of the cast is pretty forgettable.<br /><br />Is it too much to ask that the people who pen these movies actually learn something of the science that they\\'re using for their plot devices?

I am serious when I say this is one of the only movies I have seen that made me physically ill. The one and only time in my life I had a migraine occurred as I watched this and I know it was the fault of the movie!! For example, the movie begins as Lewis enters a therapist\\'s office and spends the next 75 minutes slipping on the floor and sliding off the vinyl furniture. Okay, maybe it only lasted 30 minutes--but it seemed like it would go on forever. THEN, later in the film he repeated this sequence AGAIN!!!! My head felt like it was ready to explode!! Somebody needed to tell this man to STOP! Fortunately for the studio, this film was not released since they knew it was a bomb and it was later released on cable and video. For this, someone needs to pay! If you LIKE pain and want to see other Jerry Lewis monstrosities, see most of his flicks after his breakup with Dean Martin (particularly Slapstick of Another Kind) and avoid The King of Comedy (where Lewis did an excellent job playing it straight).<br /><br />PS--Despite its being raised to \\\\\"classic status\\\\\", The Nutty Professor wasn\\'t funny.

Do you think that it must be difficult for Mr. Chamberlain to act with an opposite-sex partner on-screen in front of his very own partner who is directing him in a movie? Perhaps this is why he chooses these types of romantic roles - because he is such a superior actor and is so comfortable in the role of an attractive, sexy, leading male (and always has going back to his Dr. Kildare years). Perhaps this just goes to prove what a truly wonderful and skilled actor that Richard Chamberlain is in the entire scope of reality. When you take into consideration that this man hid his homosexuality for over thirty years, giving no clues of such to his fans while taking on very macho, leading male, and romantic roles in Hollywood, it proves what a truly remarkable, gifted, and wonderful performer Richard Chamberlain is and what a true inspiration he is to the acting community.

Hugh Laurie is also a very good comedic actor and his is delightfully naive as George who just sees the war as an adventure. Stephen Fry is also a talented comedian, and is great at satirising the leadership of the British army. Tim McInnerny is excellent as the protagonist of the series.

Example: Peter (also a black man in the movie) identified himself as Jesus (to protect him from the soldiers). But the movie has the Roman saying to Peter, \\\\\"You are not black enough, Jew!\\\\\" (!) Who researched that? And who researched the so-called love affair between Judas and Mary Magdalene? Note that Jesus never once spoke anything bad against the Romans, and there was no Roman vendetta. Think about this for a moment: Jesus rode triumphantly on a donkey into Jerusalem just a few days before his death. The Romans did not stop him. So What was this Roman manhunt that Jesus ducked to avoid detection? Actually the Bible treats the pagan Romans well. Jesus did not come for them, but for the Jews. If Jesus needed soldiers, He could have summoned legions of angels (as He said). Furthermore, who researched the so-called tension between white and black Jews!? Where is that fable written? Another ridiculous scene: The movie had Peter holding a knife to Matthew\\'s throat (!) because the latter had implied that Peter was the traitor. Then the movie, contrary to the Bible, had the Romans arrest Jesus. Jesus was in fact arrested by the Temple Guards (Jewish, not Roman).

To be honest, I\\'d never even heard of Tucker before seeing this, but it turns out that he\\'s a man that decided to build a new type of car that would revolutionise the car industry. Naturally, he faced much opposition from the bad guys along the way, but in the end good won out and Tucker got his cars made and revolutionised the auto industry forever. Oh say, does that star spangled banner yet wave...sing it with me now! <br /><br />Jeff Bridges is apple pie personified as the title character; a patriotic American that wants to live the American dream. Francis Ford Coppola creates a lovely 40\\'s style that is pleasing to the eye and gives the film a very upbeat attitude. The stylishness of the picture comes at the expense of substance, however, and that makes the film hard to like because there isn\\'t a lot of character for the audience to connect with. The American dream\\'s hold over Tucker and the way that he continually gets pulled down lend it a sort of substance, as it\\'s a comment on how adversity always exists, but it\\'s not very personal and doesn\\'t make the film easy to like. The film is also rather poorly plotted, with it all going well until we get to about the hour mark and then it takes a horrible downturn, almost into the realms of boring; this is a far cry from The Godfather films for Coppola. The film gets a little too chirpy at times as well, which will annoy and not intrigue, especially for the non-patriotic Americans in the audience.<br /><br />Don\\'t get me wrong, this film isn\\'t terrible by a long way but it isn\\'t particularly good either and despite a lovely style, Coppola can\\'t take the ball and deliver on the substance front as well.

       "  '\"William Powell and Myrna Loy! A pure recipe for alchemical gold, and nowhere better seen outside of the \\'Thin Man\\' series than here. This is a better film than LOVE CRAZY which they made the following year. This is a truly hilarious film, with a wonderful script and first rate gag lines, with plenty of opportunities for laughing out loud. The story itself is, or at least seems, flimsy and nonsensical. William Powell was hit on the head nine years earlier and has had amnesia. Having previously been a con man, he has along with the amnesia experienced a total personality change. He has settled down and become a respectable citizen of Habsberg, Pennsylvania, where he is a pillar of the community, the head of the Boy Scouts, and a member of the Rotary Club, the Lions Club, and all those worthy bodies. He manages a pottery. He never touches alcohol, his hobby is taxidermy, and he even keeps a stuffed squirrel by his bedside which he stuffed himself. He is also pathologically mean with money and counts every penny obsessively. In other words, he has become a super-bore, and his attractive wife Myrna Loy can\\'t stand being ignored anymore and has filed for divorce from this most disappointing, annoying, and unsexy husband. At this point he is hit on the head again and reverts to being his previous mischievous self, whom Loy had never known. This leads to all sorts of comedic escapades and because he now finds Myrna Loy irresistible, Powell sets about wooing her afresh as his new/old self (hence the title of the film). The strange thing is that there are documented cases in the annals of psychology of this sort of amnesia-associated personality change taking place, and also of the reverting back. It is rare and extreme condition, but it does happen. It is known as a dissociated fugue-state. (See my review of HOME AT SEVEN with Ralph Richardson where I discuss this psychological issue further.) The general public will just accept all this as \\'a bit of hokum\\', not being aware that such things have actually happened from time to time. However, this is no time to be serious. This film is intended as pure fun. It works because of the magical sparkle between Powell and Loy, which chiefly owes its magic to Powell\\'s remarkable and humorous personality and the unique response to it which seems to have emerged spontaneously from Myrna Loy from the moment they met. Theirs was a cinematic matching made in heaven. The two of them together really are so amazing that one ceases to pay any attention to what the film is about, and one just watches, mesmerized, as they interact with one another. They could be sitting and knitting or reciting the telephone book and it would barely matter. In this film, Myrna Loy finds \\'the man she always thought was hidden inside\\' her husband and \\'loves him again\\'. However, he then is hit on the head again. And I won\\'t ruin anything by saying what happens next. One of my little hobbies is imitating the cooing of doves. I had not realized that William Powell was there before me, but then I must not reveal too much about what he is cooing about, as it might not make it past the Hays Office.\"'],\n",

I was predisposed to liking it, because I was a fanatical G&S enthusiast first, but it was a relief to discover that this film was a worthy tribute to their legacy. Providence deserves the credit for forcing friends to acquaint me with the operas of Gilbert and Sullivan, when I was dead set against them (for no apparent reason). Later, Providence rewarded my open mind by delivering into my hands (from out of the blue) a 35mm Technicolor print of the film. My reason for mentioning it is that the print had an intermission at about the one hour point. It seemed silly at first, but I later discovered that the print had been shown \\\\\"double system,\\\\\" with separate hour-long reels of 35mm magnetic sound tracks. This was confirmed by an article in the Journal of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers, which stated that The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan had been one of the earliest films presented with magnetic stereo sound (before the composite magnetic prints of Cinemascope). I never found the magnetic stereo tracks, but the print also had the usual monaural optical track, of very good quality. My print eventually decomposed from vinegar syndrome, but I was able to buy a VHS tape from a G&S society in England, which apparently owns the rights. I wonder whether they own the stereo tracks, or will ever release a DVD. Are there not enough G&S fans in the world to make it hugely profitable?\"'],\n",

       "  '\"I actually had decent expectations for this one but found myself cringing throughout most of the film. There\\'s really no goal in this movie. As I contemplated the hollow feeling of having wasted a couple hours watching the film, I switched from passive viewer into active reviewer mode to determine why HTD didn\\'t work on so many levels. First of all, I wanted to empathize with Mandy Moore\\'s character, but there was nothing about her struggles that resonated at all. There was no growth pattern (aka character arc) to be found in her either; she was just a whining, disenchanted stereotype. Moore\\'s character is the caricature of the frustrated teen who doesn\\'t want to risk being loved for fear of getting hurt. Another factor that worked against the film was that they tried to cram too many subplots/characters in, and the main story did not benefit from most of that peripheral crap. Let\\'s see, we had the pregnant girlfried...the doper grandma...the father and his new wife...the mother and her new love interest...Halley\\'s aloof but totally undesirable hippie boyfriend...the sister and her fiance\\'s socio-economic wranglings. It was headache-inducing fare to be sure. Halley\\'s love interest just kept popping up, never with a context or sense of why he was where he was. What did we know about the guy? Nothing. We didn\\'t observe his home life. Didn\\'t really learn his interests. He was simply inserted into different settings (parking lots, stores, backyards, etc.) as though required by movie convention. The few scenes that were probably intended to endear us to the loser, such as the funeral speech scene, were presented pathetically with no emotional weight whatsoever. Third, the lazy writing for this film threw so much over-used tripe at us. For example, you know a film is struggling when they have a dog hump one of the principle character\\'s legs. Also, the dope-smoking grandma seemed such a tired bit as well. After those ridiculous and unfunny insertions, any attempts at serious drama in this schizophrenic film were greatly compromised. Casting and chemistry were certainly some weak points of the film as well. My significant other and I agreed that Mandy Moore did not seem in any way conceivably to be a blood relative to the mother in the film. They looked nothing alike. Granted, this is hard to gauge, but then I started to realize that other films pull this off very well. The lack of character change/growth and of any conceivable end goal also made any attempts to generate a conflict or climax to the film moot. Toward the end when the boyfriend avoids her for a while, it was merely yawn-inducing. This is supposed to be tension? This is supposed to make me concerned? Hardly. The film\\'s efforts toward the end to generate some artificial excitement were particularly cloying and lame. In particular, when the boyfriend forced his way on to the radio station\\'s air waves as though he had to do something desperate and gritty to get Halley\\'s attention, I wondered why he hadn\\'t thought to simply go to her house or call her on the phone. There was no indication that he had made any other more reasonable attempts to contact her. Therefore, what could have been a sweet moment, came off as a stunt and portrayed the love interest as a buffoon and social retard.<br /><br />I can only hope that Mandy finds better vessels for her talent in the future. Churning out garbage like this will do nothing for her reputation and continued employment in the film industry.\"'],\n",

The lighting and overall cinematography give the film both a wonderful Victorian-era feel and a film-noir aspect as well. Indeed, the film has much in common with film-noir aside from the lighting. The story, like many noir films, has a dubious heroine who leads a fundamentally disadvantaged man, in this case, a lover from the wrong side of the tracks economically and socially, to his destruction. Indeed, given the situation presented in the film, the lover couldn\\'t have realistically expected Madeleine\\'s domineering and strict father to have ever accepted him given his poor social and economic prospects. Adding into the mix was Madeleine\\'s own ambivalent handling of their relationship, promising one moment to tell her father about them, then pleading it was too difficult to do so. As history indeed bore out, it was a recipe for personal disaster.<br /><br />My main criticism of the film is that virtually nothing is told of how Madeleine managed to meet her lover in the first place. Some accounts I\\'ve read indicated that they first met in a Glasgow park. I think Lean should have shown that meeting to show how Madeleine had a mind of her own and how willing she was to defy her conventional and strict Victorian father. That would have added to the ambiguity of Madeleine\\'s character, seemingly compliant to the demands of her family in terms of love and marriage and yet defiant of them as well.<br /><br />Still, the performances, especially Ann Todd as the title character, are top notch and this is a film well worth seeing. As I\\'ve said, this is the closest David Lean came to film-noir that I\\'ve seen.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"It is clear that a Manoel De Oliveira film is not for everyone, not that he has ever tried. The cinema of this director is introspective, as it doesn\\'t aim to please the masses. \\\\\"Um Filme Falado\\\\\", his 2003 satisfying movie, is perhaps one of his most accessible.<br /><br />When we first meet Rosa Maria, a university professor, who is embarking on a long trip to Bombay to join her husband for a vacation, we watch her on board with her daughter, Maria Joana, a beautiful child with an inquisitive mind. As the ship goes to the open sea, Rosa Maria is heard explaining to the girl the meaning of the monuments in Lisbon they are passing by.<br /><br />The next ports of call include Marseilles, Naples, Athens, Istambul, Cairo and Aden. In every place the ship stops Rosa Maria and Maria Joana take side trips to see the interesting sites that although touristy, they hold a special significance and serve to advance the story. After all, Rosa Maria being a teacher knows well what she is talking about. In each destination they encounter a kind person, like the Orthodox priest in the Parthenon, or the Portuguese actor by the Piramids.<br /><br />We also see in some of the ports of call a famous woman boarding the ship, but they don\\'t appear until the last segment of the picture, when the captain, John Walesa, invites Rosa Maria and her daughter to join him at his table where Delphine, Francesca, and Helena, are sitting. Each woman talks in her native language, and yet, they all seem to understand what each one is saying. This serene moment doesn\\'t prepare us for the surprise we are about to receive. Since we have no idea about what is coming, we remain in a state of shock because of the suddenness in how things happen. In a way, the film parallel life, as it is difficult to understand why things happen they way they do. Also, the fragility of life itself is examined by Mr. De Oliveira in his own peculiar way.<br /><br />The director has given us no inkling up to the last moment of the film that anything could be so totally wrong. The whole film has such a soothing quality and a peaceful beauty that when the unexpected happens we are caught completely unaware of it.<br /><br />Leonor Silveira has worked with Manoel De Oliveira extensively. She has such a regal presence in everything she does and her beauty is the no nonsense kind. Her Rosa Maria is perfect. John Malkovich and Catherine Deneuve have also worked with the director before, but this is not their film, they just happen to be there at the end. Stefania Sandrelli and Irene Papas are also featured in the film. Ms. Papas makes a wonderful impression as she sings to the delight of all the passengers and the viewers.<br /><br />\\\\\"Um Filme Falado\\\\\" shows a Manoel De Oliveira at his best.

Why? The constant music was nothing special, and at it\\'s worst, slightly annoying.<br /><br />There are a few somewhat wooden performances. Tony Leung Chiu Wai was far better in Hard Boiled. I don\\'t think Tat-Chi Yau knew how to wring all of the potential Tony has out of him for this film, and it shows.<br /><br />There was a certain dynamic that\\'s almost a staple of the HK action/crime genre missing... The power of the weapons wasn\\'t conveyed as I\\'ve seen it numerous films over the years. What I mean is that the guns didn\\'t truly seem as powerful as they should of. The shots, underpowered, and it\\'s a bit underwhelming when I\\'m used to even pistols coming across as these loud, near deafening, definitive things. Small thing but it ran through the entire film and I think it\\'s worth mentioning.<br /><br />Could of been about 20 minutes longer, with more characters being fleshed out a bit more. Film could of benefited a lot from that.<br /><br />Bad subtitles. Quite a few misspelled words and I\\'m sure I missed the gist of multiple things because of the poor subs. Ah well.<br /><br />Those are all relatively small issues I had with though, and on the flip side it\\'s got a lot more positive things going for it. A great build-up of suspense at multiple times through the film, a pretty complex interweaving plot, two very interesting, I might dare say original action scenes which made me grin...<br /><br />To boot, it was brutal and uncompromising. No humor (Though the random, unexplained vomiting kind of teetered on it) A few nice, brutal for this kind of film scenes that pleased the inner gore hound in me. The coloring throughout the film, as mentioned by others, was nice and added a nice dynamic to the film.<br /><br />Hehhehehee, the movie also stars, without a doubt, the most unrelentingly sweaty character in the history of film. Tony Leung literally wipes his face down with a towel every few moments for almost the entire film. Hey, it\\'s the little things that I get a kick out of. He kept washing his hands and what not too. I think he had some kind of sanitation issue.<br /><br />Overall, a 7.5 out of 10 in my very personal opinion.

       "  '\"In what may be the most remarkable live action film to come out of the Disney studios during the 80\\'s or even the 70\\'s for that matter, I find the treatment it has received from it\\'s own studio appalling. The best thing I can compare it to is having a ruby but discarding it because you only prefer diamonds. Considering all the costume jewelry Disney released in the aforementioned decades, you would think they would have more respect for this gem.<br /><br />I\\'m sure parents who took their children to see Natty Gann when it was released were surprised and shocked to discover that it was not a film for younger children. It is a very dark realistic film which takes place during the Great Depression. This is not only the story of a young girl traveling across country to find her father, it is the story of people searching for hope and trying to survive in an age when just having food on the table was a constant struggle.<br /><br /> When Natty\\'s father Sol(Ray Wise) is offered a job in a logging camp in Washington, he is only given a few hours to come to a decision, either take the job and leave Natty behind, or stay in Chicago with Natty and hopefully find work elsewhere. At first, rejecting the job offer, he steps out into the Chicago streets. In a truly remarkable scene, we see as Sol does, the faces of all those who have lost hope and been beaten down in despair. It is after this brief but telling moment that he realizes, as we do, there is no decision to be made and Sol accepts the work in Seattle. Sol is forced to leave Natty in the care of a boarding house owner Connie(Lainie Kazan). After Natty overhears Connie reporting her as an abandoned child, she decides not to wait for her father to send for her, and begins an arduous journey across country to find him.<br /><br />If ever there was a film that is a picture of contrasts it\\'s this one. Early in the film we are given the harsh reality of depression era Chicago. Director Jeremy Kagan does not spare us from the details. We watch as men stand hopelessly and helplessly praying and hoping for work. There is a scene where a destitute family are evicted from their home. Later, as Sol is heading to Washington in the bus, we see another family on the road with their meager belongings strapped to their car as they head west, their car no longer operable. As Natty walks through the market place vendors sell what meager belongings they have just to get buy. When Natty runs away we see her fishing for food out of a trash can for a morsel to consume. Later, as Natty travels westward, there is beautifully photographed scenery of forests and mountains, but Director Kagan astutely reminds us of the bleakness of the depression with many scenes of the struggle in rural America, ranging from a scene of a farmer and his much pregnant wife plowing a field, to scenes of orphaned and abandoned children left to be wards of the state. This is not your Daddy\\'s Disney, kids. Dick Bush\\'s cinematography of the wilderness is breathtaking, yet in the scenes set in Chicago and in the farm towns of America, he mutes his colors to enhance the contrast between beauty and desperation. <br /><br />When Natty jumps her first train, she is help and befriended by Harry(John Cusack), who is also riding the rails. Cusack in his first major dramatic role after being extremely good in The Sure Thing, shows for the first time that he is not just a comedic actor, but has dramatic prowess as well. Harry may be young, but Cusack gives him the edge of a man aged beyond his years. It is an uncanny performance.<br /><br />Salenger, as Natty, is more than just a teenage actress. Her characterization draws us into the story from the first moments of this film to the last. It is the key that holds this film together and if it had been put into less capable hands the film would surely not have succeeded as well. Although her film career since Natty Gann has not been noteworthy, you will always remember her for her unflinching portrayal of Natty Gann. This is a journey for the ages, and one you will not soon forget. Unfortunately.......<br /><br />I don\\'t make it a habit to comment on the DVD release of films, but in this case I\\'ll make an exception. The transfer of this wonderful film is appalling. It\\'s bad enough when a film that shouts \\\\\"wide screen\\\\\" is only released in a very horrid poorly done pan and scan, but the full screen transfer is one of the worst if not the worst I have ever seen. It gives new meaning to the word grainy. At times the picture jitters so that you may begin reaching for your VCR remote to adjust the tracking until you remember this is a DVD. There are signs of the film\\'s age running rampant throughout and no visible effort to clean it up digitally or otherwise. I\\'m not one to believe every film should come with a boatload of extras, and have no problem if a studio wants to give us just the film, but there is absolutely no excuse for the poor picture quality of this DVD. This movie is a gem, and for the Disney studios to tarnish it and treat it in this unconscionable manner, saddens me terribly. What is more frustrating is the fact that Disney can do quality video releases, so just a decent film to DVD wide screen transfer would not have been a lot to ask for. They should be ashamed of what they have done to this fine fine film.<br /><br />My Grade: Journey of Natty Gann-A<br /><br />DVD transfer - F <br /><br />\"'],\n",

Unfortunately, this turns out to be a very low budget movie taking itself far too seriously in trying to create some sense of suspense and resulting in nonsense. The opening title sequence is easily the most dramatic part of Gene X. Do yourself a favour and press STOP after the first two minutes and you will have a far more enjoyable cinematic experience than continuing on to the establishing scene. <br /><br />The plot of Gene X involves a bumbling young scientist, Dr Tom Gray, working in a laboratory-seconding-as-a-lavatory, whose genetic testing on two (2) rabbits somehow heralds the results of a marvelous cancer-curing goo. However, as with all Dr Jekyllian projects, taking this substance triggers moments of violent insanity in the takeree, insanity which can only be sated by a stranglee shouting \\\\\"I know you\\'re in there somewhere! It\\'s me! Your friend! Your FRIEND!\\\\\" (or to that effect)... otherwise the only known cure appears to be a bullet through the head. Of course, the hospital in which Dr Gray is conducting his research claims the cure as their own and attempts to sell it off as all corrupt-and-drug-addicted-corporate-types do. Said corporate type is dating a nurse in the hospital, who seduces Dr Gray in order to get to the cure, as she is emotionally attached to a tumour-ridden orphan in the hospital who can somehow afford private health cover. Tensions rise as the affair is discovered and the battle to stop Gene X escaping into the clutches of pharmaceutical companies rages onward towards a most yawnworthy climax.<br /><br />The film is sluggish in creating tension throughout the rickety plot line. Every few minutes a character\\'s dialogue will be poorly dubbed. Inappropriate, Yamaha-keyboard-esquire music stings punctuate moments of the protagonist and his love interest with the comedic prowess of Trey Parker. And the acting of the minor characters is truly appalling... especially the senior ones. \\\\\"Oooh, I\\'m shaking like a leaf.\\\\\" Hilarious! The spasming of the bedridden toadfaced chemokid is also pants-wettingly funny.<br /><br />The saving grace of Gene X comes from the lead actors Patrick Magee and Ayse Tezel. Both hold up the narrative by making the best of some, at times, horrendously corny lines. Stunt doubles for sex scenes and scooter-riding are terrible, but if you approach Gene X without high expectations you are sure to enjoy the post-production ineptness and unintentional one-liner classics. \\\\\"It smells like... the ocean?\\\\\"\"'],\n",

       "  '\"LA MUJER DE MI HERMANO is a bad movie that manages, through stylish visuals, neat transitions, lush electronica used as mood music, and a deliberate plot pacing, to look better than it is. Story-wise, it would have been better off set anywhere between the Fifties, because technically it\\'s akin to the much better FAR FROM HEAVEN in melodrama, or even when this type of movies came into vogue during the period going from the late Seventies into the early Nineties. How and why it\\'s situated in the present, and even more so, that its story got through the datedness that bogs it down is a mystery, but then again, Latin America is still in a mire of its own ultra-conservative values -- men are supposed to be macho; women who take charge of their own life are seen as little more than \\\\\"zorras\\\\\" in heat, and everything happens in a very hush-hush way. So for a Latin American public, the premise of LA MUJER DE MI HERMANO may work perfectly; on the other hand, it falls into an ugly \\\\\"Splat!\\\\\" of epic proportions on this side of the Rio Grande.<br /><br />Much of it has nothing to do with its denouement, which to a degree may even then be somewhat forgivable. Its failing, and Achilles heel, is based squarely in the trite language -- both on a visual and written level -- that tries to tell an intelligent story but has nothing to hold on to. For example, we\\'re told that Ignacio and Zoe have been married for ten years, and that\\'s okay. What is not, and where the story\\'s implausibilities begin to show, is that in those ten years, they\\'ve fallen into a predictability where Ignacio can only have sex on Saturdays and prefers business traveling than being with Zoe. Ten years is a long, long time for Zoe not to notice the 500 pound elephant sitting placidly in her sleek, minimalistic and uber-contemporary living room. Maybe it\\'s those twenty grapes she has a penchant for. Then again, Dorothy Parker wrote a story called \\\\\"Too Bad\\\\\", where a married couple of seven years suddenly separated. No one knew why, but once we went inside the marriage, we saw that these two had absolutely nothing in common, not even enough for small talk. We never find out their mechanics, but it\\'s still a pretty funny story.<br /><br />This, however, is a story that takes itself seriously. Adding to the fact that Ignacio and Zoe have strange marital arrangements is the presence of Ignacio\\'s studly brother Gonzalo. Gonzalo and Ignacio are estranged as presented in exclamation points early on at a family lunch. Zoe, do-gooder that she is, contacts Gonzalo and tries to make amends. He sells her a painting, and Ignacio hits the ceiling. Fifteen minutes are spent mulling and arguing over this painting as if it had some symbolic meaning. No sooner than this happens that Zoe is confiding deep secrets to Gonzalo as if she\\'d known him all her life, and a phone conversation implausibly makes its way to Ignacio\\'s ears, but all he can do is throw the darned painting into the pool and seethe. More unremarkable events take place: Zoe also confides in who we\\'re led to believe is her best friend, Boris, a stereotypical nellie. Conversations between Zoe and Boris are built to make us understand more will come out of their friendship, but that doesn\\'t happen. The same can be said when Zoe makes Gonzalo prove to her he hasn\\'t had sex with other women, or when in a repeat scene, she makes Ignacio promise her he hasn\\'t had sex with men. It\\'s all tease and fake promise.<br /><br />So with all this teasing going on, it\\'s not a surprise as to why LA MUJER DE MI HERMANO looks good, but is quite bad. It begins with the misnomer of its title which would have Gonzalo the main narrator of the story, and ends by its sheer quaintness that never decides where it wants to take its characters and leaves them muddled in its telenovela roots. At least for a debut film from Ricardo de Montreuil, it\\'s not a flat-out failure. It sells glossy images, attractive leads that would be at home in daytime soap, the presence of a veteran actress (Angelica Aragon), and that\\'s all there is to it.\"'],\n",

I agree with another comment stating that this movie was unfairly dismissed at the time of original release. Yes it\\'s tacky, low budget and amoral -- perhaps one of the most amoral movies of the Reagan years of home video rental. For that reason alone it actually stood out from the pack by actually daring to present it\\'s viewers with exactly that which it aspired to. Unlike the Mad Max films or even the Italian ripoffs of the genre Max created, DEF-CON 4 has no presumptions about being a parable, having any kind of a message or examining some sort of social phenomenon. It is about nuclear war and the resultant breakdown of our North American collective society, and like those prospects it isn\\'t pretty, easy to stomach or even make sense of.<br /><br />In actuality there are actually two B movies in one here: A pretty taught little SNEAKERS/WARGAMES ripoff about a nuclear war triggered by \\\\\"accident\\\\\" after Lybians hijack a shipment of cruise missiles and shoot one into Russia. It doesn\\'t detonate but manages to push east/west tensions to the breaking point, the Russians nuke America and the Americans retaliate. Instant global apocalypse, and a demonstration of one of the prevailing nightmares of the Cold War. This sequence of events is ingeniously staged by having the three person crew of a secret orbiting weapons platform observe the exchange and agonize over how to react. Should they launch? Should they go back to earth? Eventually their satellite\\'s computer is hijacked by an unseen entity who prompts an impromptu landing somewhere near the coast of Canada, sparking the second of the two B movie scenarios that becomes a post apocalyptic thriller centered around a makeshift totalitarian regime dominated by the prep school brat of an Army general who recruits other brats, arms them with machine guns, and herds the surviving populace into a ramshackle town comprised mostly of junk. <br /><br />One of the astronauts encounters a survivalist hilariously played over the top by veteran character actor Maury Chaykin, who steals all of his scenes with a blase attitude (\\\\\"Just get in your rocket ship and fly off to Central America.\\\\\"), his home made converted front end loader tank contraption, and a kilt. He also has a teenage schoolgirl boarded up in his basement, the less said about which the better. His character is the only one in the film who emerges as an actual person, and when the story shifts it\\'s emphasis away from his fate it looses that central core of interest. In any event the astronaut strikes up a deal with the survivalist for the space capsule\\'s food supply and the female astronaut still on board, leading to their capture by the renegades and a series of bizarre scenes of social chaos that seem to have been inspired by Spaghetti Westerns.<br /><br />I will admit that the film is a bit of a mish-mash, and hard to keep track of because it changes gears so quickly. At one minute it\\'s a high tech space thriller, the next a grim survivalist tale, then social satire and finally a big, stupid shootout. But in all fairness it\\'s only the final twenty minutes or so that loose their footing in absurdity, with the main detraction being the role of the Army brat dictator kid, who\\'s grip on the surviving populace is never fully explained. Why are the others following his lead? Since nobody bothers to tell the audience, the kid remains a caricature rather than a character, and the final conflict between the astronaut and him remains something of a contrivance rather than a believable series of events. The ending is also annoyingly empty of any kind of meaning at all, with the movie more or less simply being over at some point. You know, whatever.<br /><br />But if anything the movie has actually gotten more poignant over the decades since it\\'s creation: We now live in a world where middle eastern fanatics do indeed shape global events & have shown themselves capable of inflicting apocalyptic events. We\\'ve also seen events like the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina where social order has completely broken down, resulting in the kind of mind boggling escapades depicted in the latter part of the film. It\\'s no longer just an escapist nightmare/fantasy to suggest that what is being depicted in the film might actually happen, and the filmmakers should indeed be congratulated for pretty much getting the look of the apocalypse right ... though I do think that people would have found more opportunities to wash their faces & would think that ammunition for firearms would be a bit more of a rarity.<br /><br />The long and short of it is that DEF-CON 4 is not the unwatchable disaster that many might have potential viewers believe. It\\'s a grim, grimy, somewhat distasteful endeavor for sure, but then again so was the prospect nuclear combat toe to toe with the Ruskies. Don\\'t knock the film for having more or less gotten the aspect of what that might mean correctly.<br /><br />7/10\"'],\n",

My reasons for doing so again are purely selfish. This film is a criminal oversight on the IMDb\\'s Worst 100 films ever made because, without a doubt, this film should be included in the top 10 of that chart. \\\\\"McCinsey\\'s Island\\\\\" is not da bomb, it\\'s a bomb. It\\'s a giant, stinking, rotten, filthy bomb and must be avoided by all except those of a highly cynical nature.<br /><br />The plot, such as there is, concerns retired secret agent Hulk Hogan who is brought out of retirement by a strangely lost-looking Robert Vaughn to recover the treasure on McCinsey\\'s Island for reasons that are never fully explained. Maybe they needed all those cheap-looking jewels and gold coins to fund a sequel, who knows? Anyway, things take a turn for the worse in every sense when evil baddie Grace Jones shows up to claim the tat (I mean, treasure) for herself. In short, it\\'s your typical family-entertainment fare which means it\\'s light on story, characterization and effects and high on talking parrots, comical violence and low-speed chases on boats.<br /><br />Actually, there was a curious phenomenon which occurred while watching the boat chase scene. Although it clearly doesn\\'t, it felt like it lasted close to quarter of an hour. Round and round they went, endlessly sailing through what looked like the Florida Everglades. And it didn\\'t even look particularly fast or thrilling, summing up the movie well. There is nothing to recommend about this movie. There is no reason why adults should watch this and there is little that even the youngest of kids will take from this. Besides, most kids these days won\\'t have a clue who the Hell Hulk Hogan is anyway unless they watched his recent WWE comeback with utter dismay. Incidentally, Vince McMahon (if you ever read this) - why bring back Hulk Hogan AND Roddy \\\\\"Saggy Tits\\\\\" Piper?

Therefore, I issue an plea to all for view this movie or read this comment. Vote for this movie and get this installed in the Worst 100 Films according to IMDb users. If you have seen it then you have my sympathy - take your revenge and vote! If you haven\\'t seen it then prepare yourself to watch a movie so bad it makes \\\\\"Gigli\\\\\" seem like \\\\\"Gone With The Wind\\\\\".

Think about the hospitals, the charities, the orphanages that might have survived had \\\\\"McCinsey\\'s Island\\\\\" never been made! Think about the children!

Remakes usually are a curse for us, horror fans, but \\\\\"Night of the Living Dead\\\\\" is a different story, since director Tom Savini obviously made this film because he wanted to tribute the original instead of using the idea of a remake as an easy excuse to further exploit a profitable franchise.

A lot of great character actors (Joe Pantoliano) didn\\'t get enough space to be interesting and there is a lot of untapped comedy resource in both Jay Mohr and Eddie Murphy.

One you can always trust to give his spirit is Luis Guzmán, and he doesn\\'t disappoint in this one either.<br /><br />All in all I would say there was a weak script to start with, that grew even weaker when it was handed to a director that couldn\\'t handle the sort of comedy it was supposed to be, nor the action it was supposed to contain. Probably actors underachieved, especially in the comedy department, due to this directing.

Though I have to say, there are a few features to this film that rescue it to just above watchable. Number one being the soundtrack, not only is there the typical orchestral score behind every dramatic scene and/or plot revelation but we are actually treated to some rock music during the occasional fight scenes. Now, being a man who believes that the soundtrack is integral to any great movie (Come on, you all remember the theme/soundtrack to all your favourite films) I felt uplifted to hear some heavy guitar music over the fights. What a great idea, it works well and I wish we\\'d hear more of it in bigger Hollywood productions. But on to the rest of the film. Performances - average to just above average. A little disappointed with Tia Carrere but to be honest I doubt there was much more she could have done in the role. Maybe someone else would have been better for the job. Everyone else was OK except for Thomas Ian Griffith who absolutely blew me away. To start I was kind of annoyed with his character but as he got more and more evil I found his time on screen to be entertaining. His lines and performance were delivered perfectly, best performance in the film. There were some OK-to-low scale special effects in this but nothing that can\\'t be forgiven on something of this calibre. Most of the fight scenes I found to be very entertaining making you follow each swing of the blade/axe, and they were carried through the film by the rock music I mentioned earlier. Better fights that I expected. Lastly but not least, even for a fantasy film the costumes were just bizarre and I think I should leave it there. The less said about them the better.<br /><br />Overall, a surprisingly entertaining movie but I wouldn\\'t recommend you to go out and buy it unless you are a fantasy junkie or really enjoy seeing Kevin Sorbo on screen a lot.\"'],\n",

It has many faults - Christian Slater just ain\\'t up to the job any more (but seems to be enjoying himself), a long and overly-talky middle act, some extremely ropey visual effects (though it has to be said that there are many good ones despite the obviously low budget), a blatant re-use of a scene from the original Hollow Man not-very-well-disguised, and a conclusion that felt very rushed - dare I suggest the budget ran out?<br /><br />On the plus side however the 2-dimensional characters are engaging, there are one or two great jump-out-of-seat moments, tips of the hat to not only the original movie but also HG Wells\\' novel \\\\\"The Invisible Man\\\\\", effective use of music (which is all new - not a rehash of Goldsmiths original) and an overall sense of fun (That\\'s Executive Producer Paul Verhoeven shining through, I think) - despite the nasty moments!<br /><br />To the people that are slating this saying \\\\\"It\\'s not as good as the first, really disappointed\\\\\" etc etc, I simply have to wonder exactly what they were expecting! Shakespeare this ain\\'t...<br /><br />But to the people who are open-minded enough to give this an honest go, you will get out exactly what you put into it. It\\'s not Shakespeare, but it certainly is Hollow Man.<br /><br />If this is the future for the Hollow Man franchise (there is the obligatory - but well executed - set-up for a Hollow Man 3), it could be an awful, awful lot worse.<br /><br />Bring \\'em on!!\"'],\n",

It features a totally off-the-wall performance by Roger Moore as an anti-terrorist expert who has some bizarre habits indeed, such as sewing, raising cats, and drinking whisky at 10a.m. Other memorable characterisations are conveyed by Anthony Perkins (the principal baddie), James Mason (a stiff upper lipped admiral), David Hedison (a stressed out oil rig official) and Faith Brooks (a strong willed lady prime minister).<br /><br />The core of the action occurs at sea, with Perkins and his menacing bunch hijacking a supply ship and planting mines beneath the oil rig. Moore is brought in to thwart them, and plays a tense psychological games with his adversaries, constantly provoking them and second guessing their actions whilst trying to ascertain the most effective way to attack them aboard their vessel. There are some well delineated scenes, such as an exciting sequence in which a couple of ships crew try to poison their captors but are found out and killed. Another invigorating sequence features Moore having to sneak up on the terrorists whilst clad in a glowing red wet suit (it was the only wet suit available to him on the oil rig).<br /><br />Moore\\'s character is wonderful. He has an uncharacteristic beard and follows a series of bizarre daily routines to the letter. His savage side, especially towards women (whom he seems to hate more than terrorists) provides some amusement. <br /><br />This is an under rated gem.

Is it genetic or is it something else something with no earthly explanation? <br /><br />The made for TV movie \\\\\"Visitors of the Night\\\\\" explores the modern day phenomena of alien abductions that has, since the first reported case back in 1961 involving Betty and Barney Hill, gone from dime store novel material to being taken seriously by millions of Americans as well as tens of millions of people all over he world. <br /><br />Time just seems to stand still for young Katie as she loses touch with her surroundings and finds herself miles from the places that she was last at. One evening walking out of a friends home during a party when she came back in,in what seemed to be a fleeting moment,Katie finds that the party was over and that three hours had mysteriously passed by! Katie for some strange reason fears the night and covers the window in her bedroom to keep the night-lights, and whatever comes with them, out. One evening she again disappears minus her eyeglasses, which Katie can\\'t see a thing without,and is found a day later miles away in a deserted wheat-field unhurt and with 20/20 vision. Katie also got very bright during her sleep-walking disappearances knowing more about politics in getting her dad Bryan ,Stephen McHattie, who\\'s running for city councilman elected then his entire election staff put together.<br /><br />Judith having recurring nightmares goes to psychiatrist Dr. Matt, Susan Hogan, for help only to find out that what she\\'s having are not nightmares at all but suppressed memories from her past. She also finds that their somehow connected to what her daughter, Katie, is having now. Fairly good film about alien abductions that not only convinces Judith and her daughter Katie that there not figments of their imagination but the real deal.<br /><br />At the conclusion of the movie we get an explanation from Judith on a spaceship with her alien captors, what the real reason for this strange enigma really is: It has to do with genetic engineering on the aliens part. The aliens are trying to create a race of alien/human hybrids and the the one thing the aliens need that millions of years of advanced science, over the human race, hasn\\'t given them: human emotions. <br /><br />Without a newborn baby being loved and cared for by his, or her, mother it loses it\\'s ability and will to survive. That\\'s the reason that women all over the earth, like Judith and Katie,who were abducted and impregnated by the aliens, are needed by the spacemen to nurture these hybrid babies and give them a reason for living. It\\'s those human emotions that the aliens, no matter how advanced that they are, can never duplicate or instill in themselves. <br /><br />Hard to follow at first with a lot of sub-plots that it really could do without but when \\\\\"Visitors of the Night\\\\\" gets to the core or \\\\\"Heart and Soul\\\\\" of it\\'s story it\\'s very hard not to keep your tear-ducts from filling up and then spilling over.\"'],\n",

Frequently it\\'s music,sometimes a quest for a rare item, rock climbing or even acting (that last one\\'s a favourite for all the rather pretentious play-within-a-play options it throws up). This film ploughs the same furrow but the obsession in this case - the piano - is more than just a showy tack-on,it\\'s the very agent of the protagonist\\'s eventual redemption. Everything good in his old life relates to his mother who fostered his interest in playing the piano; his present of moral turpitude and anger he owes to the influence of his deadbeat father. \\\\\"My heart stopped beating\\\\\" is the literal translation of the French title (\\\\\"The Beat My Heart Skipped\\\\\" sounds more like exhilaration than spiritual stasis to me!) and surely relates to this period,after Tom\\'s mother\\'s death,where Tom\\'s heart is moribund.

This is the premise for Addams Family Reunion, a rather sorry entry in the Addams Family legacy.<br /><br />I\\'m generally a big fan of The Addams Family, whether the Chas Addams cartoons, the original television series with John Astin and Carolyn Jones, or the first two movies with Raul Julia and Anjelica Huston. I was not impressed by the animated series (neither the 70\\'s nor the 90\\'s versions) though I won\\'t claim to have seen every episode.

It does however have the feel of The New Addams Family, and indeed, coming out at the same time as that series, it seems that this was released to promote and be an introduction to that series.<br /><br />This movie fails on several levels. The humor just isn\\'t funny and it lacks the darkness of the other entries in the Addams Family archives.<br /><br />Second, there seems to be a lot of miscasting here. I really like Tim Curry and thought that he would make a good Gomez. But for some reason, he just doesn\\'t manage to pull it off in this one. Someone else commented that he did a \\\\\"bad Raul Julia impression\\\\\" and that pretty much sums it up perfectly.

Wilde played the role for ten years, then he left, so next \\\\\"third man\\\\\", Seymour Utterthwaite (Michael Aldridge), a mad inventor. Aldridge then left the series, so in 1990, Foggy Dewhurst returned. Wilde played the part until 1997, when he picked up an ailment, so he was forced to retire. This looked like the end of the show, but no. Who was to be the next \\\\\"third man\\\\\". Michael Aldridge had died in 1995, so he couldn\\'t take over. It went to ex Policeman Herbert Truelove (Frank Thornton). This went on until Bill Owen died in 1999.

Both Browning\\'s and Bell\\'s exploitation expos are badly acted, technically inept, and appear to have been edited with hedge shears (some of the scene shifts in \\\\\"Freakshow\\\\\" are so badly constructed, the viewer has no idea what happened).<br /><br />Anyway, \\\\\"Freakshow\\\\\" does follow (read: \\\\\"steal\\\\\") the plot of \\\\\"Freaks\\\\\" (a white trash non-freak chick attempts to marry a circus freak to get at his money). In the original, the horny mark was a midget, but in this movie, the \\\\\"victim husband\\\\\" is a guy with bad teeth and covered with boils. The viewer gets to meet a large variety of physically and mentally deformed characters (none of whom could act) in the original. In this remake, there\\'s a bunch of freaks, too; one armless dude, one legless guy, a handful of dwarfs and a bunch of extras in bad make-up and cheap masks (none of these people can act, either).<br /><br />\\\\\"Freakshow\\\\\" meanders on really not reminding the viewer of Browning\\'s flick until the pre-wedding party scene where the freaks induct the bride-to-be into their world. If you remember that wonderful scene from the original flick (\\\\\"One of us! One of us!\\\\\") you\\'re going to hate the way it was re-imagined for this movie.

It seems that Keith Leopard, \\\\\"Freakshow\\\\\" scribe, decided that anyone who plunked down four bucks to rent this turkey deserves to see how... perhaps, I\\'ve said enough. Suffice it to say that the reason the film had no production values to speak of was because they had spent all of their money on the special effects for the last 10 gut-wrenching minutes.

       "  '\"This early D. C. Fontana episode bravely goes where TOS never went before - to the time of its own creation - the late 1960s. Another bold frontier for the series (previously explored, but less interestingly, in Squire of Gothos) was crossed as Tomorrow is Yesterday established the show\\'s sense of humor by - characteristically - poking fun at its own historical context. The original series was never equaled in any of its worthy successors in making commentary - whether comedic or serious - on its own historical context. And though not terribly serious, Tomorrow is Yesterday is a good example.<br /><br />The plot is fairly complicated and as impossible (from a scientific perspective) as most of what passed for science in Voyager and Enterprise, but the strength of Fontana\\'s dialog and the performances of the regular crew and the guest stars (Roger Perry is great in this) carries it. Enterprise, on its way to earth, is catapulted back in time by a slingshot effect relating to the gravitational pull of a star, to the late 1960s (ya, I know, a physics class might have helped here, but bear with me). The ship enters earth\\'s gravitational field partially disabled and in a decaying orbit. They are spotted and branded a UFO, and a warplane is sent to investigate. The crew must figure out a way to repair the time line, return some unwanted guests to earth without memories of visiting the Enterprise, and, of course, return to the 23rd century without ripping the ship apart.<br /><br />The episode is well written, despite the ridiculous premise, and very nicely acted. The cinematography is effective, though the effects are some of the worst in the series, and many of the long range shots of the ship should probably have been cut. Kirk engages in one of his better fight scenes - if you\\'re into that sort of thing.<br /><br />An entertaining episode, and one that established a trope for the entire franchise - engagement with the show\\'s own historical context.

       "  '\"I\\'ve always been a fan of European cinema, mostly because it has something more to offer than Hollywood\\'s mass production. Don\\'t think that I hate every movie that comes from Hollywood or that I love all European films. As well in Europe as in America, they have made some excellent movies as well as awful ones. <br /><br />If it isn\\'t a better story or more profound characters, than it is the style of filming that makes European cinema a little different from the American. And this movie has it all. The story is very good and original and the characters are very recognizable. I really got the feeling that I got to know them better, even though their lives are sometimes completely different from mine. But most important is the way everything is shot. For those who aren\\'t familiar with the rules made up by Dogma yet, I\\'ll give a small explanation: the director promises not to use extra light, special effects, extra sound effects... They want to make the story speak for itself and show everything in a natural and realistic way. To some this may seem like the most boring concept ever. I guess many people who like movies like The Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Spiderman,... movies that are full of special effects, huge scenes and nice visual effects, may not be blown away by this movie. I know that many people may hate the concept, that many people don\\'t want to see this kind of movies, but personally I find this a very welcome concept in a world where everybody seems to feel the need to copy what works, without being original.<br /><br />Kresten has moved from a small Danish island, where his parents farm is, to Copenhagen in order to pursue an excellent career and unconcerned life. He marries his boss\\'s daughter and is sure that he\\'ll become the new boss as soon as his father-in-law decides to retire. But on his honeymoon he gets a phone call that his father died and that he\\'ll have to return home. The only problem is that he has never told his wife that he had a father and a retarded brother, living together on the family farm. Once he arrives at the farm, he sees that much hasn\\'t changed or been done since he left and he decides that they will need a housekeeper to clean up the mess. He sends an advertisement to a local newspaper and he immediately gets a reaction from Liva Psilander. Liva is a prostitute who wants to start a new life. She wants to escape from an anonymous psychopath who harasses her by phone and needs a lot of money to pay her brother Bjarke\\'s school tuition. When Kresten\\'s wife discovers the truth, or at least what she thinks the truth is, she breaks off the marriage and makes sure that Kresten will lose his job at her father\\'s company and that he\\'ll never get it back. Now Kresten will have to live together with his brother, with Livia and her little brother in the old farm on the island...<br /><br />I can assure you that you\\'ll have to get used to the way of filming at first. Perhaps you\\'ll need two viewings to fully appreciate this movie, but once you can see past the style of filming, you\\'ll see that this movie has a very beautiful and hearth warming subject. Personally I really liked it and that\\'s why I give this movie at least an 8/10, even an 8.5/10.\"'],\n",

Yet Patrick Wayne leads the cast in a Sinbad tale that is curiously unengaging. Wayne\\'s casting as the title role is a strange choice. Not because he\\'s a Caucasian portraying an Eastern man, which was par for the course in the seventies, but because he has all the charisma and latent acting ability of a turd.<br /><br />His requisite love interest, Jane Seymour, is equally as wooden, and has quite a nasty character. Odd that the heroine should wish to draw blood from the villainess, with a \\\\\"Let me have the spoils of her face!\\\\\" So she can scar another woman because that woman is bad? Rather a mixed message to be sending out to the audience.<br /><br />Things only begin to pick up with the arrival of Patrick Troughton, an actor who has more screen presence in a single frame than Wayne does in the entire film. However, direction is too flat and the narrative too obscure for even the mighty Trout to rescue it. Despite the title, the film\\'s plot doesn\\'t involve Sinbad in a boxing match with Mr.T., but rather a quest to turn a baboon back into a Prince.

The effects also dictate the laborious pace of the piece. In order for the excessive animation to sit right, the actors give delicate, careful gestures when the creatures will be unconvincingly superimposed around them. So that these moments of contrivedly slow acting don\\'t seem out of place, the rest of the film is downplayed to make one uniformly tedious whole. To this end, the special effects ARE the film, the actors taking a back seat to ever sillier plasticine monsters.<br /><br />Too old fashioned for today\\'s youth, and lacking any sort of appeal for adults, this dated fantasy really is best consigned to the archives... and forgotten.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"When Rankin and Bass unveiled their version of Tolkien\\'s \\\\\"The Hobbit\\\\\" in 1977, it was a charming if abbreviated made-for-television animated film that was fun and even a bit scary. Their voice casting choices were fine, especially Richard Boone, whose cancer-rasped voice brought the dragon Smaug to life, and Theodore as the creepy and loathsome Gollum, who evoked fear and disgust but little pity. In 1978, Ralph Bakshi attempted to bring the first half of \\\\\"The Lord of the Rings\\\\\" trilogy to the big screen in his lushly animated epic. Unfortunately, his big-budget film flopped, much to the disappointment of Tolkien\\'s fans, and Bakshi would be unable to make his sequel. In an effort to finish off the unfinished series, Rankin and Bass tried to make their own version to satisfy the audience who wanted to see closure. It was and remains an unmitigated disaster.<br /><br />Why is this cartoon so awful? Well, the answer lies mainly in the word \\\\\"cartoon\\\\\". Unlike The Hobbit, which featured beautifully painted scenery that evoked delicate watercolors and ethereal linework, which had so evidently been crafted with loving care and cast with thought to matching characters to actors, The Return of the King had all the earmarks of having been hastily cobbled together. It wasn\\'t so much an animated homage to a great writer\\'s work as a hatchet job. A huge chunk of the events in Tolkien\\'s books were missing between where Bakshi\\'s fairly faithful rendition ended and this abomination began. The drawings were slapped together and were often repetitious and ugly. Voice actors from the first film returned and some of them worked: Orson Bean was fine as Frodo, Theodore was again great as Gollum, Theodore Bikel did a fine job as Aragorn, and Roddy McDowall was wonderful as Samwise Gamgee. The rest were abysmal. Instead of hiring actors to do the characters, cartoon voice actors such as Don Messick (Scooby-Doo) and Casey Kasem (Shaggy) were cast. It was downright painful to hear a Nazgull being done by Scooby Doo through a distortion filter. Many characters integral to Tolkien\\'s story were cast away: Where was Gimli? Faromir? Any of the elves (other than Elrond) such as Legolas or Glorfindel? How about the Army of the Dead or Sauroman? Merry and Pippin didn\\'t develop as characters; Gollum remained merely vile, as if Bakshi\\'s attempts to show this tortured being\\'s strangely noble and pathetic side never happened. The dialog was stilted and sometimes unintentionally hilarious (\\\\\"As the flag\\'s standard broke the wind. . .\\\\\"). It was awful beneath description from beginning to end, appearing to be a shameless attempt to cash in on the hopes of frustrated fans who\\'d wanted the second animated movie made.<br /><br />That, of course, was the entire problem. This cartoon was, despite its trappings and claims, just a cartoon, less charming by far than The Hobbit and far less noble than Bakshi\\'s film. Both of those were honest attempts at creating art, and each succeeded in its limited way until swept aside by Peter Jackson, who finally gave Tolkien\\'s opus the treatment it deserved. The two earlier films merit a place of honor for trying to achieve cinematic beauty. Rankin and Bass\\'s The Return of the King deserves to simply be forgotten.\"'],\n",

The cast:The cast do a really good job at making the people feel very real.You can feel Williams moving away from his (very good)comedies,to giving really great performances for dramas.But,the main stand outs are Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leondas as Tood and Neil.They both give really great performances that make you feel they really are friends,and that when Neil dies,Hawke does a great job at showing the sadness he has,for losing a friend in such a sad way. Direction:Peter Weire does a fantastic job,at showing how the film (over the films time-line)changes.From something that looks really picture-perfect,that could be from an old faded photo album,to some very dark and disturbing images.(With very strong religious overtones-aseptically in the suicide scene.)But Weire always makes sure that the characters are the centre piece of the film.The other thing Weir did great and was very different (at the time) for getting a really good,serious performance out of Robin Williams.

Jack the Ripper lives up to its reputation. I\\'ve no idea what the title is alluding to, but to surmise the film; it\\'s an unflinching depiction of murder and rape that is all the more shocking because of the fact that most of the film is really quite realistic. The film is a part of the \\'pinky\\' genre that was popular in Japan around the sixties and seventies, but unlike many of these films; this is not amusing or \\'fun\\' - Assault! Jack the Ripper goes straight for the jugular! The plot focuses on two restaurant employees. While out together one night, they accidentally murder a hitch-hiker. The pair soon realise that murder is their mutual aphrodisiac, and from there the murders continue as the restaurateurs begin an unflinching rampage of rape and murder, with any random stranger unlucky enough to be in their way the victim! Naturally, this relationship doesn\\'t last too long...<br /><br />The only place the film is lacking is on the actual \\'money shots\\' - we don\\'t get to see the protagonist stab his victims in the crotch, and the reason for that is down to the Japanese penal code - which states that no full frontal nudity can be shown in films. This is a shame both for this film and just about every other Japanese exploitation film ever made. However, director Yasuharu Hasebe doesn\\'t let that stop him delivering the shocks. The lack of full frontal nudity is more than made up for by the brutal violence and the film features plenty. It\\'s not a particularly gory movie, but there\\'s plenty of stabbing and butchery going on to please the gorehounds. The atmosphere is dirty and sleazy throughout and this compliments the brutal action nicely. The film is very short at just seventy two minutes, but this is not really a bad thing. The plot is very thin and while there\\'s more than enough to keep the audience entertained for the time that it\\'s on for, any longer and the film may have ended up grinding to a halt considering the thin plot line.

       "  '\"Think of me as you will. My opinion is based on the film and it\\'s message and not the Mr. Comes, just to make things clear. This film is supposed to show the traumaitzation of a man who was abused by a member of the Catholic Church when he was a young \\\\\"boy\\\\\". The problem with the whole story is, the stories that are being told are from men who claim to been abused at the ages from 12- 16. They say that they were unaware of what was happening to them and that they (the victim) would wake up and there was a man from the Church having their way with them. These story tellers say that at the time they weren\\'t sure what was happening and that they let it occur. Right off the bat, I would say that those statements have no validity. In and around the age of thirteen, teenagers know about sex in way or another. You learn it from school, society, or family. To say you don\\'t seems to be the way to cope with allowing your curiosity to happen. I remember I was in the fifth grade when we were given the crash course on sex, so at that age I was 10 or 11. Things that weren\\'t taught (obviously) I learned from peers. So at that age I was aware of what sex was and would have some sort of idea of what may have been happening. What the story tellers also fail to mention is that they weren\\'t coming forth about the abuse (if that\\'s what they thought it was then) to anyone. Not parents of friends, or any one else in the Church. They allowed it to happen and happen multiple times. I mean, once they were 16 and the abuse was continuing, there was no excuse that they would still have no idea what was happening. They show a man referred to \\\\\"John Doe\\\\\" who remembers being drunk and naked and being in bed with a alleged sex offender and nothing else. He goes on how that experience disturbed him, but then he recalls experimenting with this man. How? First he said he didn\\'t remember, but remembers everything else and was disturbed, but then allowed it to happen on another occasion. Why? This is only one small example, there are many other points that are trying to be made that get spun around based on the reactions and delays of the \\\\\"victims\\\\\" described in the film. Another example (a large one at that) is that even though one person in the film claims he is haunted by what happened everyday and that he is against the church (due to a lawsuit he\\'s filed about 18 years later), the Church is still a big part of his life. He was married in a Catholic Church, sent his daughter to a Catholic school, and we see her receive her first Communion. And feeling all this bitterness and frustration with the church, he goes in and accepts Communion with his daughter. Once again, if this is all so traumatic and one claims to be abused or raped and lied too, why go back to this church? Why accept Communion, something sacred to this church? It\\'s backwards. It\\'s things like this that hurt the credibility of this film and it\\'s story tellers. It rides the wake to a major controversy in America. It doesn\\'t seem like a documentary, but like a movie of fiction. It tries to strike emotions with circumstances that seemed staged. The point and message of this film is lost with it\\'s irony. I feel sorry for the story tellers not because of what they claim has happened, but because this film hurts what they have to say.<br /><br />to the film makers, this is a bad film.<br /><br />D- To all of you users here on IMDb, I stand by what I say. It\\'s simple psychology since we are now being told a story decades down the road from what they claim happened. Over the years stories stretch and wear, till the very foundation has changed. I still find this movie to be dis-miss able. And personally to colorscheme, my review of a bad film was straight forward to the point using references from the film, therefore I am backing up my opinion so you can see for yourself.

The Predator and the lack of it visually creates a genuinely terrifying antagonist who ruthlessly butchers his way through Ah-nuld\\'s elite squad. Ah-nuld himself is brilliant as Dutch, the ripped leader in a film strewn with brilliant one-liners (knock knock!), Ah-nuld was perfect for the role as someone fighting on the side of good rather than the evil monster-type role. Everyone else has a great part and the characters are developed well in the opening scenes, before they\\'re mercilessly butchered. Overall, the action movie to see. Predator-10/10\"'],\n",

       "  '\"I wanted to originally call this the original \\\\\"Malcolm & Eddie\\\\\" but apparently the guy\\'s name in this movie is Malcomb. Whatever.<br /><br />The blaxploitation phenomenon of the early 1970\\'s yielded some very interesting and memorable product, albeit low-budget. There were a number of black themed horror films that were made. Many are aware of the Blacula series that probably gave ideas to Eddie Murphy and Wes Craven when they made Vampire In Brooklyn during one of Eddie\\'s many low periods. Of course, they also decided to remake Frankenstein.<br /><br />The movie begins as Dr. Winifred Walker has come to her mentor Dr. Stein in Los Angeles asking for his help. Her boyfriend Eddie Turner is a Vietnam vet who came back to the U.S. with both his arms and legs amputated due to a landmine explosion. Dr. Stein is one of those \\\\\"mad doctors\\\\\", although he\\'s not \\\\\"mad\\\\\" in the sense. His experiments in healing and DNA are only known to a select few. He agrees to help Eddie.<br /><br />During the operation, which takes three steps, Dr. Stein\\'s assistant Malcomb falls in love with Dr. Walker. He professes his love for her. Winifred tells Malcomb that she can only like Malcomb as a friend because she loves Eddie and wants to marry him once he\\'s recovered. Malcomb then switches Eddie\\'s DNA with the DNA of someone (something?) else and when they keep injecting the DNA in him, he mutates into the title character: BLACKENSTEIN! Of course, Blacky goes around killing his victims; although he seems to have an agenda when it comes to his slayings. The first one who dies is a male nurse that would verbally assault him for going to Vietnam and wouldn\\'t give him ice cream. His slaying is done behind a screen and we see him pounded into hamburger and then having HIS limbs torn apart. All this while the doctors try to figure out why Eddie has mutated to this form.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is atrocious. It is obvious none of the actors were naturals. Malcomb, played by Roosevelt Jones, does come off as effective due to Jones\\' wooden acting since he is playing a simple but sinister man. I did like the spiel of victim Number One, played by Bob Brophy; it\\'s kind of a rant that was expected by the former hippies by 1973. The lighting is terrible, the sets are cheap looking and the script for the most part is on the level of George Lucas\\' efforts. There\\'s too much dead time and the movie lurches from scene to scene. And boy, does Blacky move slow and look silly with his afro and threads.<br /><br />If you do like bad movies, this is worthy, but it is missing that special ingredient that something like Plan 9 From Outer Space or Showgirls offered. There is better in every genre (blaxploitation, horror, so-bad-it\\'s good or a mix) so you should look elsewhere.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"The original BBC version of THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT shocked a nation way back in 1953 but this remake barely caused a ripple when broadcast three years ago and it\\'s not too difficult to see why . Nowadays television audiences are much more sophisticated and television in the 21st century is more of a bastard child of cinema than theater , but it would be both churlish and incorrect to state that the failings and the lukewarm reception of this remake are down to the audience because the fault lies entirely with the production team <br /><br />A lot of people have complained about the anachronistic feel of the production . Indeed it doesn\\'t really feel like it\\'s set in the present day despite the scenes set at the Tate Modern and having BBC News 24 giving away exposition . Perhaps the most startling thing are the large number of characters who smoke , something both television production teams and government have cracked down on and I\\'m possibly correct in saying if this had been made in the Autumn of 2008 none of the actors would be allowed to smoke on screen by law <br /><br />Director Sam Miller usesa countless number of medium shots . In order to generate tension and atmosphere wouldn\\'t close ups have been more effective ? Of course Miller is directing a live broadcast where anything or everything can go wrong so perhaps we should be more forgiving because of the amount of pressure he was under . Unfortunately any tension and atmosphere is diluted with the amount of clichéd POV shots and over head filming of London which outstay their welcome very quickly . There\\'s also a lack of internal logic to these shots . If you\\'re a mutating monster walking around London dressed in a cloak wouldn\\'t someone call the police , and wouldn\\'t the police be going out of their way to hunt down the mutating monster ? Are we to believe the monster hasn\\'t been picked up on CCTV cameras ? Apparently the story is set in a world where we can send astronauts into deep space but no one has invented the close circuit TV camera . Do you understand the anachronistic criticisms now ? <br /><br />Some of the problems with the script actually lie at the door of Nigel Kneale . The original version of THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT was written as a suspenseful mystery . Alas however it was constructed very much as a whodunnit . Once you know what is happening to Victor Carroon etc there\\'s little mystery involved . It\\'s similar to watching a whodunnit unfold when you already know who did it so there\\'s no surprises . Kneale did construct his story in an episodic form to be broadcast over a period of six weeks which leaves Richard Fell\\'s adaptation very disjointed . In some places it\\'s very slow and in other places so rushed you find yourself thinking if there\\'s been a hitch in the production that stopped a scene being transmitted . We also have to endure a ridiculous scene where an art lover bleats \\\\\" If you destroy beauty then we don\\'t deserve to go on living \\\\\" Oh please ! <br /><br />All in all this version of a Nigel Kneale classic is more of a nostalgic gimmick than anything else . If the BBC are thinking of doing a live version of QUATERMASS AND THE PIT then my advice is don\\'t . It\\'d be terrible to see the greatest SF drama in the history of television turned in to something like this\"'],\n",

It is much better as an action film although much of the action is chaotic, accompanied by lame heavy metal/thrash music.

Also, the humans seem to be able to travel easily wherever they have to go until it is time for another action sequence.

       "  '\"I agree with with another reviewer who thinks this might just be the worst Sherlock Holmes ever--or at least among the worst. It\\'s because this version of the great detective is him in name only--almost nothing about him sees like the Holmes of the Conan Doyle stories. Having read all the original stories, I know what I am talking about here. John Barrymore simply isn\\'t Holmes. This didn\\'t come as that much of a surprise, though, as when the movie began it said that the film was based on the plays of William Gillette--not the Doyle stories. Gillette played fast and loose with the character and added many of his own details and flourishes and over time, his plays became less and less like Doyle\\'s stories. So how could anyone expect this film to be THE Sherlock Holmes? The story is a weird variation on the original Doyle story \\\\\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\\\\". Of all the dozens and dozens of original stories, this one happens to be my favorite and it\\'s practically a perfect story. But, oddly, very little of the original story remains (just a few odd bits and pieces)--and lots of unnecessary stuff is added. To Holmes maniacs like myself, this is tantamount to sacrilege! A prince has fallen for a commoner. He isn\\'t particularly worried, as there are others in line for succession well before him. However, when those ahead of him are killed unexpectedly, he calls off his upcoming marriage--such a marriage would not be acceptable to the nation. Despondent, the lady kills herself and her sister has letters that the future king had written to his former lover. The British government want Holmes to find those letters and return them to the man who is about to be crowned.<br /><br />Okay, aside from completely changing the story into a tale involving Moriarty (who, by the way, was captured pretty easily at the end), the story did some of the most ridiculous things you could do with Holmes--it made him a sentimentalist AND had him fall in love, inexplicably, at first sight. Holmes NEVER showed anything but contempt for most women (save two) in the stories and NEVER was sexually interested in any woman--in fact, he was repulsed by them. In THE SECRET LIFE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES the film went so far as to say that Holmes was gay (and fantasized about Watson!). While the real Holmes in the stories seemed asexual, being gay at least made much more sense than having him fall for a lady and even propose to her at the end of the movie!!! This is just wrong and violated the entirety who Holmes was. Plus, Holmes acted more like an action hero and showed little of the usual methodology he employed in the stories. It was as if no one associated with the film ever read the stories--not even one. If all this is okay, why not make him a Chinese acrobat or a serial killing nudist? There was so much more about the film that was wrong or didn\\'t work but I won\\'t bother going on, as the love interest alone ruins the story.<br /><br />So what is good about this film? Well, it had lots of footage that was actually filmed in London and the scene in the mountains looked nice. Aside from that....absolutely nothing makes the film worth seeing--even if the great John Barrymore is in the lead. Apparently it took many years to piece this movie back together from various sources in order to restore the film. Too bad it wasn\\'t worthy of such efforts! Yes, you can tell that I do love my Conan Doyle!\"'],\n",

It is totally at the border of normality (meaning normality not necessarily what\\'s good but what\\'s common). The film also touches strongly the theme of hipocrisie (probably wrong spelled, this word.) once more in the character of Hugh Grant who, despite showing all the time disgut and repugnace for the story he is being told, is always secretly desiring and wanting something equivalent to happen to him (this hipocratic attitude may be the result of growing up in a world and a society where this kind of sexual liberties and practices are repressed and in here once more we are taken to atrong moral issues which take us to rethink the whole thing...).<br /><br />Apart from this questions this film makes me also think about the relationships between men and women... Is there an everlasting love? or at least an everlasting relationship?... Suddendly I recalled Schopenhauer who claimed that no man could be happy with only one woman... maybe this film is showing that he was right... the pace of the relationship between Mimi and the writer was so high that they just emptied all there possibilities very soon, but if we put that at the scale of a normal marriage, aren\\'t all the possibilities also tried at the end of 10 20 or 30 years? Can a marriage last happy for both till \\\\\"death tears them apart\\\\\" ?...<br /><br />Besides this few topics of discussion (to which I could add some more if I just remembered them right now) I found this film very well directed with some beautiful scenes... also some strongs scenes that stay with us... Excelent performances for the three leading roles... Kristin Scott Thomas is also good in here but not so as in other films also because her somewhat small part in this one didn\\'t allow her to show more than she did. This film proves once more Roman Polansky as one of the greatest directors of our times, since he shows he is totally in control of every detail of direction (I enjoyed the increase of the speed together with the increase of intensity of the relationship among the couple). Good dialogues but specially excelent speeches of the writer whenever he becomes the narrator which is often... Also an excelent note for the soundtrack by Vangelis and other well known songs which appear along. A must see.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"Narratives in movies can be tricky. Sometimes they\\'re practically a requirement, especially if the plot is convoluted or the prose style ornate, as in Raymond Chandler\\'s work. How could we survive without Philip Marlowe\\'s voice-over telling us that \\\\\"her hair was the color of gold in old paintings\\\\\"? Just as often, narrations are a crutch, as they are here, telling us things that an Old Master like Hitchcock would have used imagination and skill to tell us visually. Not only is this narrative sometimes pointless but it varies in tone, as if coming from different characters instead of just Cuba Gooding Jr.\\'s fugitive lawyer. \\\\\"There\\'s an old saying: Money talks. The only thing it ever said to me was good-bye.\\\\\" Not bad. (Echoes of Philip Marlowe there.) But then again it sounds sometimes pompous. \\\\\"Quite simply, the book was perfect.\\\\\" No kidding? What happens in this murder mystery, quite simply put, is that Cuba Gooding Jr. is a disbarred lawyer who is framed for multiple killings of other lawyers. He\\'s pretty bitter about his disbarment, after all. And he IS guilty of something. He comes into possession of a smashing murder novel written by a recent acquaintance, a wheezing old man with no family. When he\\'s told that the old fellow has died of a heart attack, Gooding quite simply appropriates the manuscript, copies it, adds his name as author, and destroys the original. That\\'s known as \\\\\"plagiarism.\\\\\" The novel turns out to be an exact description of five genuine murders, right down to details that only the police and the killer himself could have known. The pursuit is on.<br /><br />Well, Gooding\\'s narrative may sometimes become a little precious but at bottom he\\'s pretty dumb, even for an attorney. The decrepit old man, who looks suspiciously made-up from the beginning, calls himself Christopher Marlowe. Gooding doesn\\'t even blink, and I suppose there are people named Christopher Marlowe wandering innocently around, even if they aren\\'t Shakespeare\\'s contemporaries. But when a lone detective tells him about the dilapidated dude\\'s death and calls himself Goethe, maybe a red flag should have gone up.<br /><br />The location shooting, around New Orleans, is nice but judging from this film it\\'s inhabited largely by people who can\\'t act well. Tom Berenger has a relatively small role as a real detective and does as well as he can with it. Eric Stoltz, never a human dynamo, probably gives the best performance in the movie as a decadent Southern aristocrat. Gooding himself, who was fine in \\\\\"Jerry McGuire\\\\\" is an embarrassment here. His most notable achievement is sprinting down a New Orleans street with two cop cars in pursuit. No one else distinguishes himself or herself, though Marianne Jean-Baptiste carries her weight as a friendly and principled lawyer, and Mark Pellegrino is creepy enough to pass as a professor, never mind a serial killer. He has a face that resonates with Crispin Glover\\'s, for what it\\'s worth, and it\\'s probably worth a lot to an informed movie freak.<br /><br />The direction, quite simply, can be described as \\\\\"pedestrian.\\\\\" We see a scene of passion on the staircase. A man sweeps a half-naked woman up in his arms and carries her up to her room. How many times have you seen a dissolve into the camera following a trail of discarded garments slowly up to the woman\\'s bed? Don\\'t fib, now. But, actually, there\\'s a surprise at the end of this shot -- because there is nobody in the bed! A cut gives us a distant shot of the standard movie kind of human coupling: they\\'re both naked, he has her pinned against the wall, and her legs are around his hips. I\\'m not sure anyone really DOES something as uncomfortable as that but it\\'s become a movie convention, like the thumbs up/ thumbs down gesture in Roman amphitheaters, which the Romans never did.<br /><br />Well, why go on? The sad thing is that it\\'s kind of a neat idea -- framing a despised lawyer this way, even if you do drag in Faust. Simply put, though, it\\'s too bad it wasn\\'t better done.\"'],\n",

I guess the director\\'s rationale was that it\\'s better to keep your mouth shut and appear stupid, than to open it and remove all doubt. Then again I think assuming there was any rationale involved in the production this movie is giving the director too much credit.<br /><br />This film has some of the most hilarious chase scenes I have ever seen. First you have Troy\\'s epic escape from machete wielding villains via his mountain bike. I swear this scene would not end. Literally ten minutes are spent tracking Troy as he eludes a car full of goons on his Huffy. Eventually the heroes give up chasing this kid in a car and decide to foot it. Sadly enough, they come closer to catching him on foot than they did when they chased him with their car. Finally, when it seems as though these villains are about to catch Troy, he hops into the back of a truck. This is no ordinary truck, however. This is a truck owned by the dumb, drunken protagonist Zap Rowsdower... yes, Zap Rowsdower. This guy is a cross between John Candy and Joe Dirt. I think that I could use my ass cheeks as a face and be a more effective actor than this guy. Anyway, after Zap and Troy reach a gas station another hilarious chase scene ensues. Of course Zap and Troy have the last laugh. The funniest part about this scene is when the villains car treads off of a hill and takes a long winded drive towards a creek. The scene could have easily been ended by just blowing up the car, or by the villains simply hitting the brakes but NO. For dramatic effect the director had the villains speed across a 500 feet straightaway into a creek.<br /><br />The chase scenes are all good and fun, but the supporting cast is what makes this movie so \\\\\"fun\\\\\" to watch.

Conman and \\\\\"cracksman\\\\\" (bank robber) Edward Pierce aka John Sims (Connery) masquerades as a \\\\\"sharp businessman\\\\\" to enter a London gentleman\\'s club and scope out a \\\\\"ring-flash pull.\\\\\" He settles on the British Army\\'s monthly payroll for the Crimean campaign, a shipment of solid gold sent in two special Chubb safes on a guarded railroad car. Much of the film is devoted to the collection of the four keys needed to open the two safes: two kept in a very secure railway office, one by \\\\\"square-rigged\\\\\" bank President Trent (Webb) and one by oversexed bank manager Fowler (Terris). To do all this & the climactic robbery, Sims assembles a colorful crew: theater actress Miriam (Down), who\\'s also his mistress; pickpocket & \\\\\"screwsman\\\\\" Agar (Sutherland); driver & strong-arm Barlow (Downing); and \\\\\"snakesman\\\\\" Clean Willy (Sleep, in a unique & outstanding role), who can reputedly climb \\\\\"a wall of glass.\\\\\" Sutherland has one of his best roles as the gifted safecracker who\\'s both deft and hilariously awkward.

Sims will resort to anything, even murder, to protect his interests & get what he wants, but it\\'s impossible to hate him. Instead, Connery gives an outlet to the villain in each of us, the side that wants to stick it to the Man by robbing a bank or bamboozling the IRS, but can\\'t be aired in real life by anything more dastardly than voting Mickey Mouse for President without fear of arrest. Prolific novelist and erstwhile doctor Crichton, in his first directorial effort, exercises firm control in bringing his own novel to the screen, seeming to know exactly what he wants to say & how to say it.

Usually mimes can be a little irksome (maybe not, depends on who\\'s miming and how well the audience can take it), but Alejandro Jodorowksy, in his first attempt at film-making, makes this as experimental as something like Un Chien Andalou yet with an emotional core that can be understood by viewers open to it all. It\\'s based on a novella by Thomas Mann about a woman who wants both her husband and lover back, and somehow gets their heads put into the wrong bodies! <br /><br />There\\'s a constant sense of both a dream in the scenery and body language, but disillusionment in what the characters are feeling back in their not-quite selves. There\\'s the woman in particular, acted very well (she\\'s the one sprawled out on a couch or other, with black hair, at least I *think* it\\'s her), who responds to the Jodorowsky character at first with disdain, but then noticing his body changes her attitude. This is a brilliant little scene that calls back to those captivating, surreal moments in film-making of the silent era, and just in performing arts in general, where things were meant to be performed to be understood by the audience intuitively to an extent, not necessarily explained exactly.<br /><br />It might be just as well; some moments in here call to the strengths of Jodorowsky\\'s wild-man cinema even this early on, as figures in a \\'city\\' environment pass by the disheartened husband, faces coming always close to the screen like it\\'s meant to be fleeting but always impressionable via make-up and elaborate costumes. La Cravate, or the Severed Heads, also carries some unique traits as a Jodorowsky effort; the advantage of color is ever powerful and varied in tone from head to environment (different than what I expected from an underground director, especially as a precursor to Fando & Lis), but it\\'s also a work that\\'s usually more light than dark and more amusing than laugh-out-loud funny in its stabs of absurdism.

I actually managed to record it off TV only couple nights ago and I just finally got around to seeing it again. This cult film I still find to be one tasty dark comedy that has a biting satirical edge about it. It ain\\'t a perfect production and the film is highly incoherent, but damn the novelty behind it is far from generic, which made it such an engrossing and energetic exercise. Weir went onto make some prime films in the 70s with \\\\\"Picnic at Hanging Rock\\\\\" being his most vintage of his work in the period. \\\\\"The Cars that Ate Paris\\\\\" was a learning step in that right direction and a chance to find his feet. While the enigmatic story leaves many things up in the air with it\\'s odd assortment of characters and ironic turns, but it\\'s Weir\\'s creative style and sly humour that shines through. Some of the satirical comments worked into the picture is that of Australia\\'s obsession with automobiles to that of rebellion with the younger generation disrespecting their elders\\' terms. Weir is able to poke fun at these points with such nice balance of black humour and the smirking tone of it all really does stick to you without losing its way. There\\'s some unbelievably humorous quotes in the dialogue too. But I actually found some disturbing scenes in the way how this car fetish lifestyle (a guilty sin waiting to break out) has become part of everyday life for the town that the harshness devoted on unexpected motorists is simply part of the parcel. It\\'s a dog eat dog world in Paris. The actual feel of the film towards it deterioration of the town and menacingly, designed cars you could say goes on to find its way into the Mad Max films. Even a little homage of a spaghetti western standoff creeps in. There\\'s not much in a way of suspense and it lumbers about in patches, but when the mayhem escalates it\\'s plain devastating in its terrorising short bursts. The violence on the other hand isn\\'t shy either with being well conceived and there\\'s one memorable aftermath. The rural location and inhabitants of the town are simply alienating in their welcoming vibe and also with an eerie score that gives out a groovy twang that works up the mood rather effectively. There\\'s just something essentially, whimsical about Bruce Smeaton\\'s variety of tunes. The relax performances are adequate even though the characters are pretty much vacant shells, since most of the effort went into the look and thick atmosphere. John Meillon is great as the self-righteous Mayor and Terry Camilleri was solid as the timid Arthur who I actually sympathised for. The manipulative relationship between the Mayor who basically adopts Arthur as a son is an interesting set-up. Another recognizable performance that stood out was Bruce Spence as the very loopy Charlie. Simply a fun movie that\\'s hardly dull, because it rambles along with many awkward situations and black humour.<br /><br />It\\'s not for everyone, but people who are interested in Weir\\'s work or that of odd premises should give it a go.\"'],\n",

Ask me about my childhood, and if the first thing I mention isn\\'t this show, you can bet I\\'ll start humming the theme song as I think.<br /><br />Darkwing Duck was not only a clever series with great parodies of the more serious super hero shows, it was also funny without the bathroom humor or ADHD plots you get on kid\\'s shows these days. Darkwing Duck always got a message across, without being loud and in your face about it. Now that I\\'m a teenager, I\\'ve seen some of the old episodes.

Otherwise it\\'s portrayal of the South is about as accurate as The Beverly Hillbillies or The Dukes of Hazzard. I wasn\\'t sure if I should laugh or scream at the ridiculousness of this flick. Having been born and raised in South Georgia, and having spent years in Florida and other parts of Georgia and the South, I can\\'t help but wonder how long it took to find all these places. The movie goes from the armpit of Louisiana to one tiny town in the armpit of Florida over 600 miles away. Then, it sets off for the darkest speck in the Appalachians, another 800 miles away. All this is done in a beat-up old car, because apparently Southerners don\\'t own anything made in the current millennium (with Jesus hanging out of the trunk). I\\'m not saying they should have set up a musician on an Atlanta skyscraper, or even in the middle of a college football field (although that\\'s the real church of the South).

This is the land of REM and the University of Georgia. As a recent resident of a town only 30 minutes from Athens, I can assure you that snake-handling religious freaks and Jesus Saves Catfish Truck Stops are just as laughable here as they are in NYC or the UK.

       "  '\"Eugene O\\'Neill remains, some fifty two years after his death and some eighty seven since his first plays appeared on stage, America\\'s greatest dramatist. This is not hard to understand - no one ever dissected our personal miseries as well by laying bare his own tragedies. It is understandable that he rarely touched on comedy (it does crop up in some forms in his plays - in HUGHIE look at the way the hotel night man has some twisted hero-worship of the gambler crime kingpin Arnold Rothstein). Twice (actually) O\\'Neill tried comedy. First a spoof, MARCO MILLIONS about Marco Polo. The other was AH, WILDERNESS!, which was his only successful Broadway play in the 1930s - 1955. It is a lovable look at middle class, small town American family life in 1905 (about the same time that that far more horrifying version of family life, A LONG DAY\\'S JOURNEY INTO NIGHT, occurs). And because we know what O\\'Neill was going through, seeing this version is not reassuring at all. The play will amuse, but in our cynical souls we know that it is what O\\'Neill really needed and never got.<br /><br />One thing the audience never got (unfortunately) was the star of the original production. In his penultimate Broadway performance, George M. Cohan played the father, Nat Miller. The critics of 1932 raved for Cohan\\'s meaningful and wonderful performance, but we can only read of it - he was never in the running for the movie role. He was extremely difficult to work with under other directors, and would have been hard to control. It\\'s too bad. The original choice for the role at MGM was Will Rogers, but Rogers wanted to make a round the world plane trip with Wiley Post, and went to their joint death in a crash at Point Barrow instead. Still Lionel Barrymore is good as substitute for either Cohan or Rogers.<br /><br />The cast on the whole is first rate, from Barrymore and Spring Byington as the parents (note the business about the problems Barrymore has eating certain types of fish) to Wallace Beery as the inebriate uncle and Aline MacMahon as the spinster aunt. The business of the three sons, Arthur (Frank Albertson), Dick (Eric Lindon), and Tommy (Mickey Rooney), and the daughter Mildred (Bonita Granville) all helps paint a picture that is close to Norman Rockwell (although the apparently alcoholism of the uncle is troubling). But it has some terrific moments, as towards the end when Nat warns Dick about fallen women/prostitutes as \\\\\"sepulchres\\\\\". But with a knowledgeable audience of O\\'Neill fans they can put in the dead older brother who wasted his talents on booze and women, and the baby brother who died prematurely. Suddenly the glitz and glare of the 1905 small town America on the 4th of July weekend turns into the shadow world of four dead souls pursuing an endless mutual fight in a New England summer house. It is a finely made movie of MGM near it\\'s height, but the source for all the pleasant humor of the piece has a long dark shadow that is unsettling.\"'],\n",

All of their fun comes to a screeching halt when Dina discovers that she is pregnant. They have no way to provide for a child, so they decide to sell their baby to a desperate couple they find online. Paul and Maria live the perfect suburban lifestyle with a brand new model home and expensive cars, but what they really want has always been denied to them. They cannot have children. The action begins when the couples meet for the first time. Immediately it becomes clear that nothing is what it appears to be. Tension builds as ulterior motives are uncovered on both sides of the deal, and what was supposed to be an easy con for Ronnie and Dina spins violently out of control.<br /><br />The film opens with Dina hitching a ride with Peter, and she recounts her tale through a series of flashbacks. It\\'s a interesting choice for a thriller. If not handled carefully this kind of narrative structure can ruin the momentum of a film, especially one that relies on thrills. However, this film has something more to offer. The best kind of horror film is the one that focuses on social issues or stigmas and turns them around to show us what we are really afraid of. Hindsight is about choice and the consequences of materialism. How much is one baby worth? Or that boat in Florida? How far will you go to get what you want? And why do you want it in the first place? That last question is the most important. It all comes back to morality, and, of course, a nice little twist ending to tie things off.<br /><br />Technically the film is sound. It has some great thrills, built up by creative use of sound and lighting design. The actors deliver well enough and the plot has enough turns to keep people guessing. There\\'s enough gore to keep the spatter crowd entertained, and some depth for those of us who like to look in to film a little more deeply. All in all, definitely worth your time.\"'],\n",

The tone, the action, the sensual stuff is all not exactly kid friendly which is why the movie works. They didn\\'t waste their time having the cheesy annoying one liner that superheroes often have but just gave all the characters great and memorable lines. The story structure isn\\'t exactly one sided either as we go through a list of events that slowly reveal the great mystery of everything that\\'s going on. This is a very intelligent movie that stirs pretty close to Miller\\'s comics than anything of the past. The right thing for WB to have done was to have these amazingly talented people work on the live action version of the Batman movies after Burton left but instead they got Schumacher and we all know what happened after that. <br /><br />-Kevin Conroy has the absolute coolest voice in the entire world and makes Batman such an unbelievable badass.

Luke Skywalker voices the Joker and I still stand by the claim that he should have been cast as the joker in the next Batman movie. his voice work on the joker to me is the definitive one and just works perfectly.<br /><br />-Breathing new life into Elfman\\'s iconic Batman theme is Shirley Walker who just does an amazing job with the music here. I really love the choir music she plays at the end when Batman is on top of the roof and springs into action after seeing the bat signal. It\\'s so good it gives one goosebumps. The other highlight in the score is the opening music in which Walker just unleashes some operatic choral pieces to massage our ears. The best part of that music is around the 12 second mark she plays this wondering choir and brass right before the operatic choir kicks in. I just can\\'t express how much I love that piece. Without Walker the movie would still have been good but not great so I hope that more people give this amazing woman the respect that she deserves. <br /><br />-It joins \\\\\"Batman Begins\\\\\", \\\\\"Batman Returns\\\\\" and \\\\\"Subzero\\\\\" as the best Batman movies to date with music so good it\\'ll make you feel like proposing to Shirley Walker.\"'],\n",

She did an amazing job here.<br /><br />After all, I was touched, and touched is such a cliché when talking about this movie and the story behind it.<br /><br />1956 means something for everyone who has at least a little percentage of Hungarian blood in his/her veins... either you were here afterwards and saw the aftermath, either you live here now as young and have the same needs, feelings for freedom, or you\\'re living abroad and were raised on stories about Hungary and how your family had to live, run through the border while they were shooting at them... Or you\\'ve heard about the story, you know someone who\\'s Hungarian. Or even reading about it here, and seeing this movie it\\'ll change you a little bit, in what you think about Hungary.

After leaving the theater you\\'ll surely believe the people who died on the streets or in the AVO prisons were true heroes.

Maybe if I had seen parts 2-8 then I wouldn\\'t have thought this film was an insufferable piece of tripe.<br /><br />The movie opens with Jason shot by over a hundred bullets and blown apart by high explosives. Unperturbed by this, his brain lives on, telepathically urging the autopsy Doctor to eat it. Yes, really. The Doc does so in a full-gore depiction, while energy lights from Jason\\'s remains fly out and possess him. This leap from body to body continues, so that even the dubious merits of seeing a murderer in a hockey mask are discarded in favour of secondary actors with mascara hamming a \\\\\"possessed\\\\\", zombie-like pallor. There is some Freudian perspective to be had from the Jason hosts\\' retractable black tongue, though this is surely unintentional. Jason is finally reborn after a red creature grows out of a man\\'s slit throat and rapes a dead mother\\'s corpse. Classy. The high fantasy element takes any level of reality, and therefore fear, away from the movie, but I guess no one bothered to tell the makers.<br /><br />Scares are non-existent. When a shot Jason (in the form of a police officer) \\\\\"unexpectedly\\\\\" comes to life and grabs a woman\\'s leg, we see his eyes open several moments before the \\\\\"shock\\\\\" grab, thus negating any suspense. Most of the film works along the same principles, with all scares either signposted or pushed aside to make way for blood and guts violence that fails to compel. The flatness of the direction, coupled with possibly the world\\'s most irritating incidental music, make the whole thing distinctly dirge-like.<br /><br />Charismatic Steven Williams is leagues ahead of his ultra-forgettable co-stars and is wasted in stuff like this. The fair majority of horror films are lacking in value, but Goes To Hell makes no attempt at artistic worth. The performances, dialogue and plot possess not an iota of inspiration. Didn\\'t the first one have a low-key, independent feel? This one is the brightly-light product of a studio, while a series of gore-riddled set pieces vie for attention.<br /><br />You sense that parts are actually supposed to be funny, but as the \\\\\"humour\\\\\" is so lame and overstated a post-modern satire this isn\\'t. Jason Goes To Hell is everything you associate with bad horror movies, threaded half-heartedly together in semblance of a narrative. The only scene that rises above tedious is the final shot where a claw glove grabs Jason\\'s mask... a clever play on the much-touted Freddy vs. Jason flick. Maybe if Freddy had made an appearance it would\\'ve livened things up, for this is a thoroughly dull affair.<br /><br />Final marks then:<br /><br />Irrelevant macho fights that drag on and do nothing to further the plot: just the one.<br /><br />Gratuitous topless shots: 3<br /><br />Gratuitous and witless uses of the word \\\\\"f***\\\\\": I lost count, sorry.<br /><br />Film\\'s score: 2/10.\"'],\n",

There are movies I hated the first time, and hated just as much the second - Lost in Translation and In the Cut come to mind. There are movies that I hated at first, but later came to think were quite good, e.g. Sin City. And there are movies that were magnificent the first time, and even more magnificent the second. Birth is one of these.<br /><br />This movie, more than any other, reveals the lack of credibility attaching to the Academy Awards. There are always injustices, whereby the most deserving walk away without the prize. In the acting category alone, I can think of Gary Oldman in State of Grace, Cate Blanchett for Elizabeth, Russell Crowe for A Beautiful Mind, Naomi Watts for 21 Grams (hmmm, a lot of Aussies and Kiwis in there - I wonder if there\\'s a message in this). But the greatest travesty of all is not just that Nicole Kidman didn\\'t waltz away with the award by a mile or two for this movie, but wasn\\'t even nominated. One of the great pleasures of this film is watching her sublime performance as she moves gently from suppressed grief to insane grief. She\\'s the one carrying the movie, and takes part in so many outstanding scenes - the lingering shot at the concert hall, trying to explain the situation to Clifford (the best man at her marriage to Sean) during which her declining mental state starts to reveal itself, the scene in the bathroom when she reveals her insane plan to run away with the boy only to find that he\\'s a liar, the boardroom scene in which she tries to tell Joseph that none of it was her fault (probably my favourite scene), the heartrending scene at the beach.<br /><br />The movie also reveals the hypocrisy, cowardice and basic stupidity of the film establishment. It\\'s possible I\\'ve missed it, but no critic savaging this movie and its premise seems to have cottoned on to the fact that Anna was going mad, although the movie makes it blatantly obvious. Rather they like to concentrate on the couple of brief scenes in which the boy climbs into the bath with Anna, and later kisses her on the lips, both handled with taste, discretion, and restraint. Aaaah, shock, horror! The scenes are described as being disturbing, unsavory, of questionable taste. And yet for a film like This Is England, in which a much cruder relationship between a young boy and an older girl is explored (\\\\\"you look like a four old, but kiss like a 40 year old!\\\\\") the relationship is described as \\\\\"cute\\\\\".<br /><br />This, without a doubt, is one of the finest films I\\'ve seen, containing possibly the greatest performance of all.

       "  '\"\\\\\"Henry & June\\\\\" (1990) by Philip Kaufman which is based on the book by Anais Nin is a wonderful film, a rare and admirable example of how an art-house erotic film should be made. It tells an interesting story that concerns the famous and scandalous American writer Henry Miller during the period of work on his first major work, \\\\\"Tropic of Cancer\\\\\" in 1931 in Paris and two women without whom the book would not have happened. One of them is his wife, June Miller, who is a constant presence under the different names in all Miller\\'s works. The other - Henry\\'s (and June\\'s) close friend, lover, and confidant, Anais Nin. The film is an adaptation or mediation over the Anais Nin\\'s journal which she wrote for 60 years and described in it the intimate details her inner world, including experiences with sexuality, and the meetings and relationships with prominent bohemian personalities of literature and art, who came from around the world to Paris, always known as the Mecca for creative individuals. Nin said about her life long writing in diary, \\\\\"This diary is my kief, hashish, and opium pipe. This is my drug and my vice.\\\\\" Anais met in Paris provincial but talented non-conformist Miller and his exotic, sensual, and irresistible wife June (Uma Thurman never looked so attractive, as in this movie) and began affairs with both of them that would change their lives and influence enormously both Miller\\'s and Nin\\'s literary work. Anais is also known and praised as one of the first and the finest female writers of erotica. One of the reasons for film\\'s success was director/writer Philip Kaufman\\'s ability to delicately transfer to the screen the erotic intense atmosphere of Nin\\'s writing as well as the spirit of Bohemian Paris in the beginning of the 1930s.<br /><br />At the of Anais\\' request, her journal was published only after the death of all the participants in the events. Anais\\' relationship with Henry and June, which led to her own realization as writer, served as the basis for the Philip Kaufman\\'s film. Kaufman wrote the script together with his wife Rose, and made a brilliant, disturbing, outrageous film, which had made history by having been the first USA film to receive the NR-17 Rating, so called \\\\\"kiss of death\\\\\". Henry and June is an adult film in the literal meaning of this word, it is the movie made for adults which explores in the insightful, exiting and artistic way the motivations, inspirations, and desires of the famous figures of Art. The acting is universally good with terrific Maria de Medeiros as Anais Nin. It is impossible to take one\\'s eyes off her face - so charming, lovely, and desirable she is. She possesses the power of commanding the screen and she is the best thing in the movie which belongs to her Anais Nin.\"'],\n",

They might be able to pull the new timeline crap in a new Star Trek movie but it doesn\\'t work when we\\'re talking about a new history of The United States. The show goes through an overview of the history of the the CSA from 1860 to the present. There is the Spanish American War where this new American invades Mexico. Scratching your head yet? Did it ring a bell yet? If you said Mexican wasn\\'t involved in the Spanish American War because they were no longer a part of Spain you win the cookie. So we invade Mexican, Annex the country, and then enslave the Mexican people. We couldn\\'t even catch one bandit named Pancho Villa down there in 1917 and these people who made this what if movie think that we could conquer and rule Mexico We might have beaten .Mexico in the 1847-48 Mexico War, but to occupy and rule the county is another war, and one we would have unlikely won. The insurgency that would have followed would have lasted decades, especially since we intended to make the Mexican people slaves. However, let alone Mexico, this documentary has us conquering and ruling South America, too and enslaving those people. Ruling counties like the British Empire did is one thing and could very well have worked (since the British didn\\'t turn the people into slaves), but when you enslave the people, you fuel the embers that heat the fire insurgency. Rule them maybe, enslave an entire country without dire consequences, fantasy. ..<br /><br />One sequence of the film shows Abraham Lincoln being exiled into Canada. In a filmed interview of Lincoln in 1905, he ponders on how he wished he could have helped the blacks gain their freedom. I guess the Spike Lee and Willmott are unaware that sound movies were not invented until 1918 and not commercially used until 1920, usually little two minute news clips. <br /><br />The last segment shows the election of Richard Nixon and John Kennedy. (That those two would still be candidates after all these timeline changes or that there are elections at all in such a country is truly mind boggling). I think the election it\\'s to show Democracy as racist and evil. Nixon is shown to be the pro slave racist (We all know that Republicans are all racists, right- see Lincoln the Republican) and Kennedy is shown to the emancipator trying to stop slavery. And the assassination (which once again, in the real timeline, was tied to Oswald\\'s trip to Russia and his being a communist- No cold war with Russia, remember?) is shown to be a conspiracy to keep America in slavery. After this, the revolt by Black Americans (This timeline\\'s version of the civil rights movement) is put down. There are innuendos in this part as the black insurgents are called terrorists by the media, and a black commentator from Europe says something like \\\\\"One person\\'s terrorist is another person\\'s freedom fighter, a reference to today\\'s war on terror and a back door way of displaying sympathy for today\\'s terrorists who attacked America on 911- a very clever attack by Lee and Willmott on their own country. Later, we see Ronald Reagan as a strong supporter of slavery. <br /><br />Throughout this bad piece of liberal and racist propaganda are what if TV commercials, showing white people selling products that all have a heavy derogatory slam against black people, insulting both their intelligence and humanity. However, these commercials have another motive, an insidious motive that labels white people as natural born racists, and vilifies whites as the oppressors of the world. To imply that blacks can\\'t be racist but whites can is a form of racism that is as bad as any Jim Crow law. <br /><br />I could probably go on but I\\'ve made my point. Spike Lee is a racist. He hates white people and wants to vilify them and show them to be inherently evil, which is racist. Hitler did a similar thing when he made documentaries showing the Jewish people to be sneaky, perfidious, and greedy.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"Written directly for the screen this horror film has a captivating and staggering story. Almost every scene from beginning till ending is full of action and tension sequences, which are done by good camera work. Its way of storytelling is very smooth. I watched it with subtitles; even though the script is very substantial, it isn\\'t necessary to follow up each conversation. The dialogue and connection which Pablo and Malena established together magnetizes the full attention from the viewer, since their body language and gestures were complementary with the screenplay.<br /><br />The story takes place in August 2001 in Argentina. Pablo and Malena, who are in their mid-20s\\', are siblings from a dysfunctional family. Their father whom Pablo never seen in his life before, is in coma. They visit him and Malena introduces him to Pablo. Malena has grown hatred for his father, for he served under Anti-Communist Dictatorship of the Argentinian army to quench the communist movement torturing thousands of innocents, instead of looking after his family. There is a huge question mark here: Why are all the communists introduced as innocents in this film? <br /><br />The frightening fact here is that when Pablo and Malena think that their father is helpless in coma, he turns out to be more powerful than he was alive. His spirit continues to torture the restless souls of the dead innocents. He has written a detailed diary including how he tortured the families of communist vanguards when he was young. In return to his weakened body, he bargains with one or more daemons to continue on his dictatorship mission. One of the daemons in the look of a little girl finds this diary from where he hided away. Then Pablo, the curious and adventurous one of the siblings, gets this diary from that daemon, assuming that it was something the little girl lost. So the daemon begins to bugger around Pablo and Malena. The diary which has the curse of the daemon brings only trouble to them.<br /><br />Aparecidos has the meaning for \\\\\"Seen versus Disappeared\\\\\". Who is seen is the Dictatorship regime runners, and who is disappeared is the slaughtered rebels against this regime. Soon, Pablo and Malena read the diary and start a journey to save the victims of the murderers. One of the communist vanguards ,who has never been captured by the police due to the lack of evidence, has been killed with his pregnant wife and little daughter in the hands of Pablo and Malena\\'s father. Daemon completes the bargain with continuously torturing the wife and the daughter\\'s souls.<br /><br />When you feel like you accomplished something, you think that you must be happy and be proud. Then suddenly you realize that you didn\\'t accomplish anything; the confusion in your mind and senses leads you realize the fact that you just decoded something hidden. That was Pablo\\'s confusion in the movie. When he was explaining to her sister what he was really trying to do, he says that he was gone out of his mind and trying to save someone whoever is dead already. Every night at the same hour in the same motel in the same room, the same murder takes place involving the same dead corpses continuously for the last 20 years. Who are you going to save? Save a dead tonight. Amazing concept, isn\\'t it?\"'],\n",

Joseph Cotton and George Sanders were at the end of fairly successful film careers and about to be relegated to guest appearances on a variety of television shows; the most notable being Sander\\'s Mr. Freeze on \\\\\"Batman\\\\\". Debra Paget was in her late twenties; she had lost her glow and was used up by Hollywood standards. The change to an unflattering \\\\\"strawberry\\\\\" blonde look exacerbated the problem as few actresses have ever been less suited to a light hair color. <br /><br />On the plus side, the movie itself is a fairly accurate adaptation of Verne\\'s story; at least the book\\'s illustrations appear to have been used as models for the rocket and the cannon. Verne\\'s 19th century take on space travel turned out to be more accurate than most of the speculation during the first half of the 20th century. <br /><br />The adaptation\\'s biggest problem was altering Verne\\'s story by inserting a topical theme about the post WWII arms race. In Verne\\'s 1865 novel, the Baltimore Gun Club itself set about building a rocket to go to the Moon. In the adaptation a munitions manufacturer (think \\\\\"Destination Moon\\\\\") concocts the scheme to demonstrate his powerful new explosive. With a lot of discussion about science, weapons, and peace the movie dances around the subject extensively yet never makes a coherent point about its position (regarding the nuclear arms race), as if simply inserting the theme is somehow sufficient. <br /><br />The movie is a cross between \\\\\"Destination Moon\\\\\" and \\\\\"Rocketship X-M\\\\\", combining the former\\'s good science and bad political message with the latter\\'s dismal sets and comical special effects. The acting in all three films is equally sad. <br /><br />The premise has munitions manufacturer Victor Barbicane (Cotton) discovering an explosive (Power X) capable of firing a shell-like projectile to the moon. His plan is opposed for philosophical/religious reasons by Stuyvesant Nicholl (Sanders), another manufacturer. Although these philosophical differences play an important part in the story, they are never convincingly elaborated on, which undermines the basic storyline. <br /><br />President Grant orders Barbicane to abandon the project because it is considered an act of war by other nations. While this is unconvincing it does serve as Barbicane\\'s inspiration to change the project to a manned space flight. Nicholl then agrees to manufacture the ceramic coating needed for re-entry and to accompany Barbicane on a flight to the moon. Paget plays Nicholl\\'s daughter who hides inside the rocket just prior to take-off. <br /><br />\\\\\"From the Earth to the Moon\\\\\" is often confused with \\\\\"First Men in the Moon\\\\\" which was made five years later. Probably because both are set in the 19th century and both feature a female stowaway (played by Martha Hyer in the later film). \\\\\"First Men in the Moon\\\\\" (while not a great film) is superior in virtually every detail to \\\\\"From the Earth to the Moon\\\\\". Rather ironically it was adapted from a story by \\\\\"H.G. Wells\\\\\", an early science fiction writer often compared to Verne. <br /><br />Movie adaptations of Verne\\'s books were a big thing in the 1950\\'s and early 1960\\'s.

       "  '\"After Oprah, I had to submit my overdue review. We all here know what this film is about. Black woman falls in love with white man. It was a sweet story that was muddled by pretentiousness and caricatures. I went in with an open mind, after reading all the reviews in IMDb.com and I must admit, much better than I had expected. Does that mean I was moved by the performances? No. Does that mean it should be nominated for Oscars? No. Does that mean it is a thought provoking film that is going to open up the floor for dialogue amongst great minds? No.<br /><br />Downside: I totally do not approve of the \\\\\"proving I\\'m a down a** sister scene.\\\\\" It was pointless and too obvious. It would\\'ve probably worked much better with subtlety. But the final cut I had seen doesn\\'t show much room for correction.<br /><br />Upside: I can tolerate the irony of Brian and Kenya meeting again in the next scene at the garden party. However, does the film benefit from irony in a closely examined issue in America like race relations? Downside: Kenya admitting that she was being rude to Brian wasn\\'t believable for her character. She comes off as a strong headed, stuck in her ways type of girl. It comes too early in the film, showing us her in this sort of \\\\\"Hooray, I survived the three ghosts of Christmas past,\\\\\" dramatic change.<br /><br />Upside: I did like the scene where he explains what needed to be done for her garden. For me, that\\'s how real people talk no matter what their objectives or unconscious desires are. It\\'s smart and it will be the only scene of subtlety from here on end in this film.<br /><br />Downside: Donald Faison\\'s character sounds too ignorant to make me believe that he\\'s as educated as the film wants us to believe. His \\\\\"cartoonish\\\\\" behavior only overshadows any sign of his supposed intellect. I not only didn\\'t believe that he was Kenya\\'s brother, I didn\\'t believe that they lived on the same block or were even in the same film. He was also offensive for no reason and annoying. Didn\\'t do much for his character. He needs to stick to \\\\\"Scrubs.\\\\\" Donald\\'s ignorance only echoes throughout the film with other annoying characters like Mike Epps\\' character. Why would he even come at Brian like that when they were double dating? Wasn\\'t he new to the picture as well? Who gave Mike Epps\\' character permission to be the designated older bro of Kenya? I didn\\'t believe it. Just more time to saturate the characters, making their efforts seem that much more irrelevant.<br /><br />Downside: Kenya\\'s friends are these supposed success stories, but they sound like Dashieky and them on the corner. I know plenty of educated sisters and their so used to \\\\\"reeling it in\\\\\" that you\\'ll never hear them talk that ignorant, talking about \\\\\"having big head kidz\\\\\" and all that bull. They were talking crazy in the back office of a synagogue during a Jewish wedding, very loud and \\\\\"ghetto.\\\\\" I didn\\'t believe it for a single second.<br /><br />Oh, it gets better.<br /><br />Downside: Now let\\'s all agree that Blair Underwood\\'s character came off as the supposed \\\\\"I.B.M.\\\\\" Educated, handsome, successful, whatever, right? Kenya had even expressed to the people close to her how great he was. Then why would the writer and director allow his character to totally go left only to make the crisis that much more easier for Kenya? Why would they bring down the value of the telling by making him become that superficial, weirdo that we all love to dislike? Doesn\\'t that make the right choice blatantly obvious for Kenya? It was an easy way out and it wasn\\'t even believable. It would\\'ve worked better if Blair Underwood were still a great guy until the end, exemplifying the patience, sincerity and charming qualities that made Brian the winner, and then some. It would\\'ve worked better if Blair Underwood\\'s character were beyond competition for Brian, allowing Kenya to make the hard choice to follow her heart, regardless of how she would make \\\\\"white\\\\\" look \\\\\"right.\\\\\" Those are the best love stories, when a man or woman has to choose between two great people, leaving them no choice but to follow their hearts. Wouldn\\'t that had made a bigger statement? And why did Kenya feel the need to bring Brian back to the cotillion in that Mexican suit? Could both the writer and director have made us see how much Kenya accepts Brian for who he is no matter what her friends and family say in a different, more profound way? It killed the film. Now she has something to prove. Pity. And she\\'s using poor Brian to prove it.<br /><br />Memo to the writer and director: \\\\\"back to the drawing board with this one.\\\\\" Memo to Oprah: \\\\\"you need to stick to talking about nothing rather than what films are good. Let\\'s not forget Beloved the countless other films you had put your stamp of approval on; White Chicks, Diary of a Mad Black Woman, Madea\\'s Family Reunion, Crash and many, many more.\\\\\"\"'],\n",

       "  '\"This is an exceptional film - not because most of the critics say so, but for me because I cannot think of any other film which left me with a greater feeling of having been temporarily transported to another world in a place and time with which I was totally unfamiliar.<br /><br />Many IMDb users have reviewed and commented on this film and another full review is unnecessary, but bringing out its exceptional nature and encouraging those who have not seen it to do so does require some supplementation. Comments about the nudity in this film not being disturbing come into this category. Today nudity occurs in films for two principal reasons, firstly because it would be natural for the character concerned under the circumstances being depicted by the film, or secondly because it is being used by the director to add a little eye candy intended to increase the visual appeal of the film. In the latter case the viewers personal reaction will govern the response to such eye candy, (typically for example, regardless of whether or not they themselves appreciate it, many viewers feel that this is very inappropriate for younger viewers and all films should provide advance warning when it is present). But where the nudity is an integral part of the story being presented, viewers who wish to see this story should not find it disturbing unless the nude scenes are excessive or gross. Pretty Baby is not such a film, it is one where Louis Malle has minimized his use of nudity - any less and the nature and character of the scenario he has to depict could become distorted. He should be commended on his restraint which may have made it much easier for some viewers to concentrate on the more serious issues raised in the film.<br /><br />When this film was first released the sequence showing the brothel auctioning the virginity of their new girl to the highest bidder raised a lot of eyebrows, and clearly many in the audiences had not appreciated that this practice used to be commonplace. Most viewers found the sequence disturbing, but in Pretty Baby the fact that Violet had been raised to expect this, and was looking forward to it as an important step towards entering adult life, greatly reduced its impact. Another film, French Quarter, which was released the same year as Pretty Baby, was the story of an orphaned girl who had been strictly brought up on a farm, but who had had to take refuge in a city brothel to avoid starvation when her parents died. Those who saw it will remember that it included a similar auction which I for one found much more harrowing to watch as it clearly showed the trauma inflicted on an unprepared and very reluctant young girl, starting of course as she was being stripped and paraded for public exhibition. Any such sequences provide very uncomfortable viewing for most men, who tend to thankfully take refuge in a conviction that they could never occur today.<br /><br />Other scenes showing the exploitation inherent in life as it was lived in Storyville in 1917 were also found to be disturbing by many viewers; and some comments even suggest a widely held conviction that we live in a more moral society today. Before we condemn our forbears we should perhaps examine this conviction in more detail. In Europe and North America we have quite recently moved away from a society where marriages among the upper classes were regarded as primarily intended to enhance social status and generate offspring. Wives frequently did not love their husbands and, although they dutifully provided children, they were often happy for him to exercise his virility with paid companions. Visits to a local brothel, where regular customers could became friendly with all the staff, were condoned or even approved. This often led to a reasonably stable environment for the young women concerned. Today most of us would strongly disapprove of such lifestyles, and would rightly emphasize how far we have progressed by ensuring young people have the opportunity to choose their own lifetime partner; but we still need to be honest about the problems this new lifestyle has created today. There were few Robert Pickton\\'s feeding twenty-six victims to his pigs in Victorian times. Today we frequently encounter police warnings about serial killers; in Victorian times Jack the Ripper was a much more unique character. Too many of today\\'s prostitutes shiver in the rain or snow on street corners throughout long evenings each night, periodically spending an infrequent few uncomfortable minutes in a car - each time at an unknown risk to themself - and are forced afterwards to give almost all their takings to a pimp attached to the local street gang. We need to recognize that many of them would probably regard living in a comfortable and stable brothel, such as that depicted in this film, as akin to heaven on earth.<br /><br />Ultimately this is the powerful message from Pretty Baby that makes it such an exceptional film; but because the Director decided to employ a totally non-judgmental documentary type presentation and to minimise any direct emotional appeal, most viewers probably only recognize it when scenes returned to their memory during the hours and days after they left the cinema, and I do not believe its rare combination of beautiful imagery and haunting power has so far been brought out adequately by the comments on this database.\"'],\n",

Although people who are not members of the Church of Jesus Christ of latter-day Saints might be sceptical of the ability of a missionary to heal the sick, I think that it is important to depict a true story in its truest form, and John Groberg truly worked miracles in Tonga. I think that the majority of believers in the world (and most critics seem not to be!) believe in miracles, whether they be through a young mormon missionary or any other faithful follower of God, and I think this would have only enhanced the story.

I would even consider this film to be a great painting of the common people. A lot of films take the escapist approach to deviate its content from real life; in my opinion that is a perfectly legitimate way to make films, and while Singles certainly has its share of over-the-top moments (which are highly enjoyable), I found it to resemble life more than most genre films. And, if art is to imitate life, then I consider Singles to be a successful work of art.

His films there, vary in quality, but the best of them is this doomed romance with Kay Francis, One Way Passage. The title itself tells how poignant this film will be.<br /><br />Powell is a fugitive who is tracked down and brought aboard ship in handcuffs by San Francisco Detective Warren Hymer. Powell escaped while being transported to San Quentin to be hung for murder. At the same time good time party girl Kay Francis is traveling home essentially to die. Unsaid at the time because the audience knew what the effects of bootleg liquor were on some people from the Roaring Twenties. Her organs are generally failing and she\\'s coming home to die.<br /><br />These two people are as poignant a pair of lovers as has ever been brought to the screen. Neither knows about the other and the aura of heartbreak just permeates One Way Passage. It\\'s a cosmic joke played on them, both finding in each other a reason to live and both knowing it can\\'t be.<br /><br />Warren Hymer plays it a great deal straighter than he normally does. He\\'s not the brightest cop in the world, but he\\'s a far from the dim witted hooligans he usually is cast. Aline McMahon and Frank McHugh are a pair of confidence workers who both team up to help the doomed Powell and Francis. McHugh repeated his own role in the remake of One Way Passage from 1940, Till We Meet Again.<br /><br />The most cynical heart will melt in seeing One Way Passage.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"For the particular movie fan, The Beat That My Heart Skipped, is a slice of intensity, wonder, and subtlety that can only come from Europe. The director/co-writer, Jacques Audiard, has taken a film previously made by James Toback called Fingers, starring Harvey Keitel in the role now occupied by Romain Duris, and made it his own. If I had seen the original version I would make a couple of comparisons to it (at the least, for those who didn\\'t see the original the remake makes you want to check out the original, if only for the acting appeal of Keitel). However I did think about another wonderful French film in the vein of this film- Francois Truffaut\\'s Shoot the Piano Player.<br /><br />While Truffaut\\'s film is a little more concerned about the lead\\'s relationship(s) with women, I felt a kind of connection between the material of the two pieces- sometimes intense, usually lyrical, tales of a person trying to find what fits more for them, the more criminal side, or the artistic side. And, much like Truffaut and his other New-Wave counterparts, Audiard successfully takes an American formula picture and forms it well into a French setting.<br /><br />There are a few reasons to recommend the movie, one would be for the music, which gives repeated but specific renditions of a Bach tune. Another would be just for the technical-side, which is well-done in hand-held, neo-noir style by Stephane Fontaine. Another could even just be for how Audiard tells his story, or sometimes doesn\\'t tell it: a couple of times mid-way through the film, I wondered if the story of this character would \\'go\\' anywhere, which can either make or break a film of this kind. It pleasantly (or intensely) did, bringing a catharsis for a viewer by the final scenes.<br /><br />But likely for most the prominent reason would be for the realistic acting, in particular by its star Duris. As I said, I can\\'t make comparisons between a heavyweight like Keitel and Duris (whom I\\'ve never seen in a film before this), but on his own terms Duris creates his character believably. It\\'s at times a complex character, or sometimes not- he has that kind of attitude and face where you don\\'t know whether he\\'s really a \\'street-level\\' guy or more straight laced. The split that is also apparent in the character\\'s parents, one a classic pianist who\\'s passed on (the mother), and the other a more criminal-type of a father, also gives the film an added boost of psychological energy. The lead in this film, much like with the storytelling (or lack of it), dictates how it may turn out.<br /><br />In the end, Audiard and Duris make it compelling enough for the film to be about him, his conflicts, his lusts, his music. It\\'s a wonderful movie that seems to have passed under the radar (it\\'s in only a few theaters around the area) amid other independent summer fare, but if you\\'re an enthusiast of character-driven thrillers that give a bitter-sweet edge, it\\'s a must-see.\"'],\n",

Several similar films were re-dubbed during the 1960s and the efforts were, to put it mildly, very sad. But it\\'s easy to tell its Communist origins--dig those crazy Commie hairdos so popular in the 1960s! This film begins with a scientist announcing that a famous meteorite that struck Siberia and laid waste to so much of it in 1906 was actually a Venusian space ship! Because of this, he urged the international space effort to change their plan to visit Mars and go to Venus instead\\x97who cares about the extremely high temperatures and metal-smashing atmosphere (two facts never mentioned in this film). In fact, who cares that in this film there is no zero gravity in space, rockets decelerate when the engines are cut in space (space is a vacuum or near-vacuum\\x97deceleration does not occur in this state), people are thrown about the ship as it steers and other \\\\\"facts\\\\\" that are contradicted by the laws of physics! Once the ship nears the planet, one of the crew members figures out the Venusian language and realizes that these people were planning on attacking the Earth and wiping out everyone. Now their goal is to reach those in charge on Venus and convince them not to attack. However, various radioactive attacks are launched on the team once they near the planet and things look pretty bad for the Earth. And, when they finally are able to penetrate the planet\\'s defenses, a surprising thing is learned about the Venusians themselves.<br /><br />The film looks extremely primitive today, but when it debuted its special effects and costumes were actually quite advanced. With 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and subsequent sci-fi films, we\\'ve come to expect a much higher level of sophistication in the look of space travel but if you look at the film in context, it was well done. My biggest problem isn\\'t the effects but the last 25 minutes of the film\\x97when it just becomes incredibly talky. Again and again, the characters just go on and on and on as well as come up with amazingly uncanny conclusions about Venus\\x97things they could have only gotten by reading the script!

This wasn\\'t a coincidental choice, as the novel (and even more so the classic 50\\'s film starring Kirk Douglas) largely introduced and immediately popularized the notorious Kraken-monster. The Kraken, these days primarily known as the thing that swallowed Johnny Depp in \\\\\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\\\\", is a gigantic type of squid that can reach a size of nearly 46 feet and reigns over the darkest depths of the sea. Normally the Kraken only lives in the Northern regions, like the cold seas of Norway and Iceland, but according to the script of this low-keyed and forgettable made-for-TV creature feature, the monster can easily also dwell American ocean stretches and it suddenly even got promoted to being the guardian of ancient Greek artifacts!

Lots of things are happening in Grand Hotel when several different persons with different motivations check into the hotel.<br /><br />The movie follows several different characters in the movie who all in a way get connected to each other. All of the characters are in the hotel for different reasons. It makes the characters very powerful and interesting to follow. The movie might not be as old fashioned as it might seem at first sight. The movie might be made in 1932 but the story and its characters sure don\\'t feel old fashioned and the movie doesn\\'t fall into some typical genre clichés. The movie is unique in many ways, which makes this movie a very enjoyable one to watch, even for those who normally don\\'t watch early cinematic pictures.<br /><br />The movie has a wonderful cast. John Barrymore is good and convincing as the thief with a good heart, Baron Felix von Geigern. Greta Garbo shines as always and so does Joan Crawford, whose performance is perhaps a bit underrated. Lionel Barrymore goes over-the-top at times but at least I could stand him this time. I normally can\\'t stand him in movies but I must admit that he entertained and perhaps somewhat surprised me this time.<br /><br />Yes, so its really the cast and diversity of characters that makes this movie a greatly interesting one to follow. At moments there is nothing much happening on screen but due to its characters the movie still remains interesting throughout its entire running time. You just never know what\\'s going to happen next in the Grand Hotel. <br /><br />It\\'s interesting to note that the movie won an Acedemy Award for best movie but it wasn\\'t even nominated in any other different category.<br /><br />A surprising and entertaining movie that is great thanks to its characters and storytelling, which makes this movie a very good- and interesting one to watch.<br /><br />8/10\"'],\n",

During that time, although I had forgotten the title entirely, there were aspects of this film that stuck in my brain and likely contributed to a few random dreams; I remember not really following the plot as a child, but I recalled finding it A) very beautiful, and B), unbelievably dark. Certain scenes and characters have stayed with me with dogged persistence---a swarm of jellyfish that seem to electrocute or burn their victims to death rather than poisoning them; the deaths of two juvenile characters that hammer home the realization that, like in the film *Cube*, every last character is expendable; and the image that probably haunted me most of all, the scene towards the end involving a forced cocooning that speaks volumes about parental coercion and a pigheaded refusal to see reason. Many reviewers have compared the story to Romeo & Juliet, and although I wouldn\\'t have understood the analogy as a child, I\\'m sure I recall the realization that, however majestic and omnipotent the combatants (Sea and Fire, in this case), the conflict presented is nothing more than a childish feud, a pointless and senseless sparring match that will probably never see a true victory. Pretty disturbing themes for a film allegedly for children! Now that I have recently rediscovered the title(s), I would greatly enjoy finding this film again, if only for old time\\'s sake.

       "  '\"X-Men is my favourite comic book series, I have been a fan of the comic books and the animated series in the 90s and I was excited when I found out that they were making an X-Men film. I was round 14/15 at the time it was released and the only bad thing about my experience seeing the film was the popcorn (American can\\'t make sweets to save their lives).<br /><br />X-Men is a wide ranging series which tackles a lot of plots and issues. It has been considered to be a metaplor for the civil rights movement in the 60s and the comics have tackled other issues like the role of the government, the AIDs virus and the Holocaust. There is also the issue that powers may be a curse rather then a blessing e.g. Rogue and Cyclops. There are also a number of characters and fractions which would have made the film difficult to make because there would have been no way to make the fans 100% happy.<br /><br />The plot of the film is in the world they are mutants, people with powers that can range from being psychic to changing your apparent to healing to controlling the weather. They are met with fear from the general public and they are calls in the US Senate for the Mutant Regisration Act, to get details of every mutant in the USA. Within the mutant community there are two major factors, the X-Men and the Brotherhood of Mutants. The X-Men, led by Charles Xavier, want to have harmonious relations with humanity whilst the Brotherhood, led by Erik Lehnsherr/Magento, believes that the human race would never accept Mutants and that a war is coming. In the middle of this are two mutants, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Rogue (Anna Paqulin). Wolverine can not remember his past and lives a nomadic lifestyle and Rogue is a teenage runaway, who needly kills her boyfriend just by kissing him. Mangento wants Rogue so he can complete his scheme to turn the world\\'s leaders in mutants.<br /><br />This film was not particular action packed; this was because the budget was $75 Million which is nothing special for a summer blockbuster, and the director was Bryan Singer, who\\'s most famous film before was the Usual Suspects, a psychology crime thriller. He chose to focus on character development which was a good move. He also tackled the project as an outsider, he was not a fan of the comics, but I thought that was good because he was able to cut of the flak. He made the film into a realistic sci-fi film which could appeal to the fans and normal movie goers. He made a few jokes about some of the issues of the comics, like the codenames and the costumers. The film does tackles ideas like Wolverine\\'s tortured past and his rivalry with Cyclops, Xavier\\'s friendship with his rival Magneto, the human factor, Wolverine\\'s need to protect children, the list goes on. The film also has a good international cast, Patrick Stewart, Sir Ian McKellon, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, James Marsden and Anna Paquin. The film also made Hugh Jackman into an overnight star because before the film he was an Australian Stage actor and after it he became an A-lister and has a strong scene of loyalty to the franchise. To a lesser extent Rebecca Romjin has also become a major actress.<br /><br />The film isn\\'t perfect, I would have liked to have seen more characters like Gambit and Beast, and the film did ignore Wolverine\\'s and Sabretooth\\'s hatred for each other and the fact that they have a past together. X-Men was an introduce to the film franchise, especially to people who do not know the comics.<br /><br />X-Men is a very good film, X-Men 2 is even better and X-Men 3 was one of my most biggest film disappointments. I would love to see Bryan Singer back in the director\\'s chair and ignore the third film and do it the way he wants and the fans want.\"'],\n",

There are reasons for this. The most obvious is that much of what they\\'ve produced has just been crap. Look at Jason Alexander. Aside from the wonderful \\\\\"Duckman\\\\\" cartoon, his two live action series, \\\\\"Bob Patterson\\\\\" and the recently canceled \\\\\"Listen Up\\\\\" (which was unwatchable, formula treacle), were both ratings duds. This is a guy who, on Broadway, was practically George M. Cohan! Same with Michael Richards (Kramer). His lone attempt at solo fame (\\\\\"The Michael Richards Show\\\\\") was mystifyingly terrible. It seems that all of the \\\\\"Seinfeld\\\\\" cast have made bad career moves since the show ended. At least, Julia Louis-Dreyfus has tried to be conscientious. She\\'s been in some duds, sure, but her previous attempt, \\\\\"Watching Ellie\\\\\", was a good show, that just needed a little retooling. The cast was sharp, it was well-written and she was bubbly and easy to watch. The major problem it had, was that it felt like some of the later Laurel and Hardy movies, the plotting was a little trite. I understand she had a lot invested in that program, her husband wrote it, they both produced it. So when the nincompoops at NBC decided they weren\\'t going to give it a fair shot, it must have been a bitter pill to swallow. She\\'s been on hiatus for a few years; I suppose, just to let the smoke clear. Now, she\\'s back with \\\\\"The New Adventures Of Old Christine\\\\\", and believe me, this one is complete junk. For starters, she looks terrible; wan and sickly, with circles under her eyes and primarily, she plays a punching bag. If Elaine Benis was rife with insecurities, Christine\\'s insecurities are eating her alive. Here\\'s the premise: her husband (a lackluster milquetoast of a man) and her were having marital difficulties, so they went to a therapist, who, we find out, episodes in, is a nasty incompetent who was having sex with the guy. Like everything on this program, the shrink is a broadly drawn cartoon. If this woman were your marriage counselor, you\\'d be looking for a new one mid-way through your first 45 minutes. But, okay. So, when the series begins, Christine\\'s spouse has already walked out on her, for a younger, NICER woman, who is also named Christine; hence, NEW Christine. Brutal. She\\'s moved into a not so great apartment, has trouble making ends meet, nobody likes her... . I mean, how do the producers think that anybody who\\'s EVER lived through a divorce (what- 75% of the USA now?)could find humor in this? Mostly, Old Christine doesn\\'t even have suitable responses to the group of sharks around her. The supporting cast either doesn\\'t care, doesn\\'t have any use for her or they simply want her gone. None of this is even mildly amusing, let alone witty but worst of all, there\\'s simply nobody to root for. Hamish Linklater, as her odd, clueless, immature brother, is the closest thing here to funny, but his part is written in such a peculiar way, that I wouldn\\'t be surprised if, in a future episode, we all find out he\\'s a serial killer. Her ex-husband is a shadow, her young son is one of these kids who was hired on cute quotient, not ability. The 3 rich, snobby mothers at her son\\'s school are beyond contempt, but compared to Dreyfus\\' mewling, neurotic, battered, apologetic Christine, I almost feel sorry for them; at least they can stand on their own two feet. This is a show about how a decent woman who\\'s made some mistakes, gets smacked down by life at every conceivable turn. It\\'s painful to watch and it needs to go.

But when a film like Dark Ride comes along with no regard for originality or even any attempt to really be good, it just makes me angry. When I\\'m not impressed by a film, I usually just don\\'t comment here. But when I feel insulted, I feel I have to speak up.<br /><br />Expendable \\\\\"college-age\\\\\" pretty teens with problems sums up the cast, and as for the plot? There was not even an attempt to try something new. You\\'ve seen it dozens of times before, and even those other ones weren\\'t that good. Teens with the typical cliché personalities go on the road to spring break, and stop by an old amusement park to stay the night at the dark ride there. Just happens to be the same night a psychopath from a mental institution shows up, seems he used to live in that dark ride years ago. Arguments, pot smoking, sex, look-at-my-boobs, and lots and lots of running around and around (like the cast of Scooby Doo trapped in a warehouse/castle/candy factory/etc.) The company that put together this film, My2Centences (though backed by Lions Gate), must have only put 2 cents into this project. Remember how the \\\\\"ride\\\\\" was supposed to have cars on tracks? Um, did anyone actually see any tracks when the teens were roaming around, going in all kinds of directions, rooms, etc? Though in the prologue the car seemed to have a direct route, some overhead shots showed fog trying to hide that there were really no tracks. Even though Bill warned a gal to watch out for the tracks (much later, at that), you could clearly see on the floor there weren\\'t any, and while they went into other rooms there was no logic to the place, no real directional way that the tracks would be able to take a car around in them. There were plenty of shots of things hanging and dropping down, dummies popping up nowhere near where the ride would have been going....you get the idea. It was a set that was a bunch of walls, halls, and stairs that didn\\'t have any use. Lots of fog too to make the set look more busy. While Jim (dufus guy) was in the basement trying to fix the power later, there was no reason electrically powered dummies and items would be there in the first place. Oh, yeah, actually just for the camera to show a close-up of to fill in time and \\\\\"scares.\\\\\"<br /><br />Surprises? None to speak of. When Bill ran off and was never seen again until the end, how could any viewer not be suspicious? Reminded me of Farley Granger disappearing early in The Prowler (1981) and even when a character in Scream 2 was just NOT there for 2/3 of the film and shows up again near the end.<br /><br />Some that have praised Dark Ride (one person on here actually calling it a modern masterpiece!) go on about it being an homage to those 70s and 80s slasher flicks, including The Funhouse (which didn\\'t scare me when I saw its initial run in theatres in 1981). Honoring other films that are supposed to be classics is one thing, but just taking elements from them to slop together a new film with no real care for its own personality is quite another. I could just imagine the folks responsible for Dark Ride saying \\\\\"give the kids what they usually will go for: violence, gore, pot smoking, and boobs (well, usually ignoring what the gals would want to see nudity-wise). They\\'ll easily be distracted by those things and probably won\\'t notice there\\'s not much else going for this.\\\\\" Frankly, I\\'m surprised I didn\\'t hear the word DUDE throughout the film.<br /><br />I like that the After Dark horrorfest opted for indie projects in 2006 (even if it was more economical), and some had real merit to them, particularly Unrest, Reincarnated, The Abandoned, and The Hamiltons (Penny Dreadful was fun enough, just padded though with extra victims). Dark Ride was the worst of the lot for me. I can forgive a film for being bad if they actually TRIED to do something creative, but Dark Ride was a clichéd, tired, and tedious disposable project. I have a suspicion that Lions Gate would have originally just released this as a DTV title, but since they were going to be involved releasing the After Dark titles, they forced Dark Ride into the bunch (notice how \\\\\"A Lions Gate Film\\\\\" was on the beginning of the credits, while basically the other After Dark titles didn\\'t). They should not have touted that these films were too much or \\\\\"too graphic\\\\\" for most audiences -- if that were the case then these would all be NC-17. I don\\'t listen to hype, and went into these films on my own, finding some worthy of being very creative and some just plain wastes of time (like The Gravedancers and Wicked Little Things being no more than \\\\\"Sci-Fi Channel productions\\\\\" that you\\'d watch on a Saturday night).<br /><br />You win some, you lose some.

       "  '\"The time around 500 A.D. truly represented the Dark Ages in England. The Romans had left Britannia, and the native Britons were dealing with an invasion of Angles and Saxons from mainland Europe. While the origins of the Arthur legend are obscure, the story is well known. Arthur, Merlin the Magician, Sir Lancelot, and Guinevere are familiar characters to most people, who know the story of the Knights of the Round Table. Arthur is generally thought to be a real person of this era, but no one really knows for sure.<br /><br />Of course, while there\\'s no concrete, verifiable record of Arthur or the other characters in this film, that doesn\\'t matter; director John Boorman has created a movie that is magnificent in its scope, and vividly tells the Arthurian legend in entertaining style. The film pulls no punches in its portrayal of the brutal, difficult time of the late 5th and early 6th centuries. During battles, men didn\\'t hide and shoot weapons at one another from cover, instead they clubbed and stabbed each other to death in hand-to-hand combat, resulting in bloody carnage on a massive scale. Boorman also has included some pretty steamy sex scenes, showing us that life during these times was not all bloodshed and battle.<br /><br />The movie gives us colorful portrayals of Merlin, the sword Excalibur, the Lady in the Lake, and the ascent of the young Arthur. Eventually the Knights of the Round Table fall into disorganization and decay, only to be acquitted on the battlefield by an older Arthur and Lancelot, who find glory one final time. Long but never boring, bloody but realistic, \\\\\"Excalibur\\\\\" is simply enchanting and enthralling. Try to catch the widescreen version\\x97you\\'re cheating yourself otherwise.\"'],\n",

David.... \\\\\" The thing is, she is an unknown person in a strange town and a team of psychiatrists try to find out the reason behind her madness.<br /><br />POSSESSED is a good, soapy yarn told in flashback with some nice twists and turns, directed quite well by Curtis Bernhardt who gives the movie a moody noir feel, and while at times Louise\\'s character can be quite unsympathetic, going from possessive to manic to moody (and more so once \\\\\"David,\\\\\" played by Van Heflin, re-enters her life), there\\'s a certain sorrowfulness about her inability to start again with her own life as a married woman, and thankfully Crawford is able to convey this perfectly. One powerful sequence which shows how great an actress (as opposed to star) she would have become if given true roles and a chance to emote while expressing little is the fantasy sequence where she imagines she has killed her step-daughter (Geraldine Brooks). Brooks has been going steady with Heflin and Crawford, not over him yet, is seething. When she confronts her, there is a struggle, secrets are revealed, and down the stairs goes Brooks. Then Crawford realizes this never happened, but to see her cruel eyes staring out from a face that looks tortured and evil and demented all at once as she waits for Brooks is chilling and the best thing in the movie.<br /><br />The only flaw in the film is the need to explain Crawford\\'s descent into schizophrenia at the end: it recalls the same procedure Hitchcock would adopt for PSYCHO. Madness is always best when left undiagnosed, but then it was deemed necessary, and this robs the film of what might have been a perfect ending: Crawford screaming \\\\\"David! David!

But first, he must find the requisite funny \\\\\"sidekick\\\\\" (he chooses young, black Antoine, whom Blake likes immediately despite his fear of the cliche their relationship creates).

In the light of his coming out as a gay man, there is an added poignancy in his playing a character who is impervious to the charms of the numerous sexy females who throw themselves on him. While the reasons for his psychopathic behavior do not stem from latent homosexuality but rather some extremely half baked mention of his mother, perhaps Hanson utilized something of Hunter\\'s sexuality in casting him in this role.<br /><br />There really is no reason to search this one out unless you have some interest in the varied careers of Hanson or Hunter.

Don\\'t Panic is a painfully slow & tedious film to watch with only two murders for well over an hour of it\\'s running time & lots of boring exposition & unnecessary character development for the rest of it. The dialogue is pretty bad, the acting is very bad & the character\\'s are awful. The film tries to conceal the killer\\'s identity & to be fair it might work, unfortunately the version I saw revealed the killer on the back of the video box so I knew who it was all along, I doubt it would be that much of a surprise though. No explanation is given to who Virgil is, what he want\\'s, why he\\'s killing these specific teenagers or how he is able to possess people\\'s bodies. Virgil is just \\'there\\' & we have to accept it. The character\\'s are all stupid, the situations Don\\'t Panic depicts are all stupid & as a whole the film lacks any sort of fore-thought or intelligence behind what\\'s going on. The ending is awful as well, both how Virgil is defeated & that sickening & tacky \\'this rose will never wilt as long as there is love between us\\' scene. Despite what you may have read there is actually very little on screen gore, two people are stabbed which Don\\'t Panic depicts by having blood splash over the floor & on the victims clothes, there is a fairly decent slit throat even if I wouldn\\'t just sit impassively in a car as someone stuck their hand in through the window & sliced my throat open with a knife & a scene in which a knife (it\\'s the same knife in all the murder\\'s actually) is stuck into someones chin & it protrudes from their mouth. All the kill scenes are dull with virtually no build up & director Galindo fails to inject any tension, scares or atmosphere into them just like the rest of the film in fact. There isn\\'t even any nudity either, in fact when Micheal & Alexandra have sex it is squeaky clean stuff, Galindo merely shows them kissing each other on the lips while in bed. As mentioned already in other comments the sight of Micheal running around in his babyish pyjama\\'s is both bizarre & very silly looking. Don\\'t Panic is technically average, the cinematography is static & flat as are the production values in general & the horrible music seems very out of place. There are a couple of scenes where a face pokes out of the TV which is quite an impressive effect. Overall there is very little I can recommend Don\\'t Panic by as it\\'s a pretty terrible film all round really, maybe it\\'s good for a few laughs & a decent slit throat but that\\'s it.

It\\'s obvious watching this movie the first time that something is missing. In trying to make a double-album-soundtrack, they sacrificed character development by jamming in as much music as possible.

Which leaves a reckless coming-of-age story to play out like a two-hour music-video. Sad in one way, the film could have been so much better, but it did give the movie a cult-like quality which set it firmly in a specific place and time. What\\'s left often seems unreal and senseless, but Alvarado and Johnson are just so convincing with the little bit that they were given that one isn\\'t always inclined to notice (which leads me to wonder why neither actress went on to bigger and better things).<br /><br />Much speculation has been given to the lesbian-theme-aspect of the film.

Alvarado, who\\'s initially shy and insecure, winds up shedding her wallflower image to idolize and embrace the ideals of her new friend. When Alvarado\\'s focus shifts towards Curry, a jealous and drunken Johnson lashes out as if she\\'d just been cheated on. And just to annoy fans of the film, scenes from the trailor showed a scene (that was ultimately cut out) where Johnson and Alvarado splashed around and played in the river. Wouldn\\'t it have been scandalous at that time to have two young girls in their early teens portrayed in a gay relationship? (Then again, many didn\\'t realize the gay-themes that were so blatant in \\\\\"A Nightmare On Elm Street 2\\\\\" when it was first released five years later.)<br /><br />It\\'s been rumored that other lesbian-themed footage was shot and subsequently cut out, but since the film was such a forgotten flop, we may never know how much. I\\'m willing to bet this could have been an epic four-hour movie. When the DVD was being compiled, Achor Bay Entertainment did a search for missing footage, but they were unsuccessful at locating any. We\\'re left only to imagine what the film could have been if they had toned down the music and stuck to the original vision. Perhaps one day. ..\"'],\n",

       "  '\"\\\\\"INDIGO\\\\\" Movie review Indigo the movie resonates with an underlying feeling of that which has been conceived in the utmost and purest of intentions. The fruition of this pure intention translates into an extremely creative and awe inspiring endeavor that this reviewer hopes to be just the first of many more to come. The team of Director Stephen Simon (Prod. \\\\\"What Dreams May Come\\\\\") coupled with Executive Prod. /Screenplay writer James Twyman (author \\\\\"Portrait of a Master\\\\\") and the endearing and talented Co writer/Star Neale Donald Walsh (Best-selling author \\\\\"Conversations with God\\\\\") is a winning combination and a literal dream team at it\\'s finest. One can not help but feel the care and love that went into this work as it translates brilliantly through the screen for audiences of all genres. Simon, Twyman and Walsh successfully deliver a priceless message of hope that the children of our future hold \\x96the Indigo children. While viewing Indigo, this reviewer could literally feel waves of inspirational subtle energy radiating through the screen permeating an aura into the theater that at times could be described as no less than breathtaking.<br /><br />As for the acting, I was equally impressed with the performances of the male lead Neale Donald Walsh and his co-stars. Walsh brought the character of Ray to life in an astoundingly multidimensional performance. Thereby setting the bar for the rest of the cast who proved to be equally brilliant in their well defined characters. Of course, when good actors have a well developed script to work with, and an inspired director, it\\'s practically axiomatic that the movie will be a true winner. With brilliantly executed editing that powerfully segued the characters back and forth into key points in the past and how they relate to conscious choices that affect their collective future, a tapestry of love was woven tighter and closer until one is so involved in this movie that you realize you are laughing, crying, and feeling an empathy and compassion for even the least redemptive of the characters! This enlightening story magically and expertly relays an underlying theme that we all have the ability to see with the eyes of Divinity while intuitively being led to make conscious decisions for the highest good based on good character and values -such as dignity integrity, and unconditional love. After opening to more than 700 theaters and churches worldwide, I pray that everyone who saw this movie will call their local independent theater and request future showings so it might reach into the fabric of our society and thereby bringing Spiritual Cinema to the for front. The power of the media is so huge, and it is such a refreshing change to enjoy a movie that is interesting, well made and inspiring on so many levels all at the same time. May you leave this experience with a singing heart, a fuller Spirit and a tenant of hope. And at the very least, may this movie remind us to stop and honor with gratitude those precious children within our care; as they truly hold Divinity within their spirits and the future of this world at the tip of their fingertips. Either way, after partaking in the magical mystical movie Indigo you will never again look at the world the same!

       "  '\"I must state from the very beginning that I have not seen \\\\\"Fingers\\\\\". Some critics keep praying it and saying how much greater it was. Really? I haven\\'t heard of it so far (not that I am much of a film connoisseur!). I am a normal human being who went to the cinema to see a film very hard to tell friends about without blushing (because it has such a poetic title, lyrical, as some put it). These are just my impressions.<br /><br />The moment I went out of the cinema hall, I though the combination real estate mobster - gifted pianist was highly unlikely in any case, but rendered almost believable by Romain Duris. I thought he was a brilliant actor. I watched and couldn\\'t believe it, an actor of the same rank as Daniel Auteuil...can\\'t think of a young American actor to match. He DID render the whole thing believable, because I am not a fan of classical music either, and I had that music from that film in my mind ever since. Anyway, I see the film as a story about failure. You realize that you are on the wrong track and you want to go back, you do everything in your power to gain your former self, but you ultimately fail. And that is, I think, when his heart stopped beating. When he failed the audition. I think, in a metaphorical way, it stopped beating forever afterward, although he kept on living. But this is my own pathetic and pessimistic view. My friend, who saw the film with me, said the title refers to his emotion when he sees his mother\\'s former piano tutor. I guess that\\'s a more optimistic view!<br /><br />oh and I forgot the most important thing. It is equally about totally mad and insane courage to turn your life around as it is about failure, and it should be praised for showing that. In 9 American movies out of 10 the lost hero decides to take life in his own hands, strives and struggles and fights, loses days and nights and sweats and spills blood and...surprise! He finally wins, his effort is rewarded! How comforting! Let\\'s just take a bow for a moment before a film which DARES show that actually, in these situations, in 9 cases after 10, YOU LOSE.

       "  '\"Mèxico, being an almost 100% Catholic country produced several nunsploitation flicks in the 70\\'s. Before censorship took a big role in Mexican movies, there were many, many exploitation flicks for different tastes. I must admit that this isn\\'t a masterpiece by any means, but it is a movie that deserves a chance and will please fans of gore and sleaze. <br /><br />Many Mexicans tend to easily \\\\\"scare\\\\\" with plots like the one in \\\\\"Satànico Pandemonium\\\\\" because it deals with two restricted topics in Mexican society : sex and religion nastiness. <br /><br />\\\\\"Satànico Pandemonium\\\\\" does not rank high on the exploitation Heaven but it manages to deliver quality intense violence and disturbing images for those who enjoy this kind of cinema. The language used in this movie is macabre and it\\'s very relevant for the plot. If you speak Spanish you might enjoy it more than if you watch it with sub-titles because most of the words have no exact literal translation.<br /><br />The raw acting is a key factor in the movie. For example, the afro American nun that cries all over the convent because of her depression for being black is something that may seem random; you just watch her cry and suffer. The scene takes relevance as the plot develops (she\\'s \\\\\"aided\\\\\" by Sister Maria who convinces her to commit suicide).<br /><br />Many situations like that one make you think \\\\\"where\\'s the coherence with these Mexican film makers?\\\\\" but that\\'s just to add tension. Also, the convent is very creepy mainly because of a great art direction. The atmosphere in the convent is sinister and the fact that the Devil is prowling outside, makes it even more a scary place. I praise the cinematography because the movie is visually stunning. The events take place at noon at night and the movie still looks sinister.<br /><br />The music is also convincing and very disturbing. The director knows how to create a disturbing, scary setting with the correct use of light, sounds, and suspense. The acting is not that good because most of the main actresses were amateur, except for Pezet who delivers a brave, solid performance. She\\'s a beautiful woman with nerves. She was perfect for the role because she\\'s extremely pretty, has an angel face; the perfect prey for Satan. She deserved more leading roles in her career. Too bad that this was her last movie. She was just too beautiful to be involved in Nunsploitation flicks! Veteran t.v. and movie actor Enrique Rocha gives a strong performance as the Devil and his voice is scary alone. He was great. The rest of the cast is just plain and dull. <br /><br />The movie goes directly to the point immediately after it starts. After the opening credits, Satan seduces Sister Mary and then the Horror starts immediately. She is tempted in several scenes, and finally, when she falls into Satan\\'s tramp, she starts a rampage of sex and murder. Thank you! <br /><br />Maybe Europeans aren\\'t easily scared with topics like The Devil seducing or torturing nuns,but here in Mèxico it\\'s a different deal. The Devil is by far the scariest character in Mèxican culture. Now, if you mix him with religion (which is something very delicate here) you have a terrifying experience. In the first minutes there is auto flagellation (good gore) , lesbian nun sex, and Satan. Mèxico created this interesting premise which sadly, in the 80\\'s and 90\\'s was heavily banned because of a censorship campaign against violence in cinema. I\\'m glad that these movies get DVD releases for Europe so they can recognize the country\\'s talent in Horror. <br /><br />The main problem with this movie is the lack of continuity and coherence in the plot. First, we only know that the movie takes place in the inquisition times because of the tombs of the nuns. So, the movie is set in the mid 1600\\'s. Then, what should we realize about the ending? It\\'s too easy to blame the Devil! but it does no makes sense. <br /><br />Anyways, \\\\\"Satanico Pandemonium\\\\\" has become somewhat a cult nunsploitation movie; it was even referenced in \\\\\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\\\\". The weak point of the movie is that it hasn\\'t aged very well. The veteran director is heavily influenced by classic theater techniques and acting and does not gives a dynamic mood to the movie. The camera angles are boring at some points, and some events truly last longer than they should. For example, when Sister Maria takes care of the sick cow, or when she realizes she\\'s been tempted by the Devil.<br /><br />At some point it looks like a very old Horror movie but with lots of gore. Talking about gore, the movie has two highlight gory scenes in my opinion. First, when Sister Maria seduces and later stabs Marcelo to death. The scene is weird because it makes you wonder how would it be if a nun \\\\\"like that\\\\\" would seduce you, and later, it grosses you out. I felt sorry for Marcelo\\'s tender grandmother. The other scene, is when Sister Maria is stabbed to death by the other nuns. The gore is great in this movie. Expect stabs, self punishment, and a glorious flashback sequence involving the inquisition (excellent for those who like gore). <br /><br />Mèxico is not all about raw, cheesy, gory flicks involving wrestlers, with no plot. Mèxico had a HUGE potential in the genre but as many people know, politicians and Constitutional Presidents banned the rise of Mexican exploitation. Sure, it came back in the 80\\'s but not as a Horror sub-genre; it came among low budget Action movies and the typical Valentìn Trujillo flicks.<br /><br />Give a try to \\\\\"Satànico Pandemonium\\\\\" because it offers blood, gore, a scary plot (for us who respect the religious factor), and a dark atmosphere. Buy it for all of it\\'s goodies. I believe there\\'s an unrated version.\"'],\n",

Hilary Swank is a great actress yet she couldn\\'t even save this film. DJ Qualls, Stanley Tucci, Bruce Greenwood and Glenn Morshower are all good actors yet they all together could not save The Core. The worst actor in the film is Aaron Eckhart and I find it odd that he gets work in Hollywood. Jon Amiel directs and he does a poor job of doing so. The only thing this film had that was above average was the special effects. Everything else about this film was pretty bad. The acting was bad and the dialog was pretty lame as well. The direction was bad and there was very little character development. Some of these things don\\'t really matter in this type of film but it becomes more noticeable when you don\\'t find the movie entertaining. The science isn\\'t realistic though that\\'s a given.

       "  '\"When audiences went to see the latest production of a tragedy by William Shakespeare at the Globe Theatre, there was a universal reaction by the spectators to what they were seeing on the stage. It was one of sadness, anger, sympathy and relief. The sadness was normally due to the innocent victim (who was usually a beautiful woman) being murdered in an unjustified fashion, such as Desdemona in \\'Othello\\'; the anger would have been directed towards the villain in the play whose dastardly deeds had resulted in the deaths of heroes and heroines - here we have Iago, arguably the most evil character in the history of literature (\\'Othello\\' again); sympathy was not for the devil, but for the poor people who had overcome the denouement but had to deal with its consequences (Horatio perhaps in \\'Hamlet\\', or maybe Father Laurence in \\'Romeo and Juliet\\'); and lastly relief was felt because the audience had survived the play\\'s violence and could thank their lucky stars that they did not have to live in a world so cruel. Now stay with me here, because there is, in fact, a point to all of this. I believe that Fincher\\'s \\'Seven\\' is the modern Shakespearean tragedy, the modern \\'Titus Andronicus\\', if you will. The feeling that washes over you when the credits roll in Seven (which are damn good credits I might add, start and finish) is on a par with a great Shakespearean tragedy, and it is for this reason why I think that films such as Seven should be considered as more serious in a literary sense. Not only that, but the film even introduces the audience to legendary texts such as Dante\\'s \\'Inferno\\' and Geoffrey Chaucer\\'s \\'The Canterbury Tales\\' - so I would be inclined to try and influence more English professors to watch this film. <br /><br />Now here\\'s the part where I say \\'Yeah Seven, woo, it\\'s awesome! Yeah!\\'. I\\'m just going to go out and say it: this film has everything that you could possibly be looking for when watching a movie. The script, for one, is great. Original, funny in places, exciting, sexy...the list is endless really. Well played Andrew Kevin Walker; the boy done good. Next we have the acting which, to put in a Romantic sense, is sublime: people may argue that Morgan Freeman can only play one character, but I think it\\'s similar to the situation with Hugh Grant (his one persona may be a bumbling, lovable fool, but he is damn good at it) and it\\'s the same for Morgan. Here he is at his fatherly, worldly-wise detective best, and the comic double act of Freeman and Pitt is essential to the film. Pitt\\'s performance is probably just about overshadowed by his portrayal of Tyler Durden in Fincher\\'s other chef d\\'oeuvre \\'Fight Club\\', but in no way is this a demeaning statement to Pitt. He is, or was, one of my favourite \\'younger\\' actors (that\\'s the Ed Norton, Johnny Depp ring, as opposed to the Pacino/De Niro/Hoffman circle of expertise) until 2005 came about - Ocean\\'s 12, to put it mildly, disappointed me greatly. However, let\\'s think positively: with Seven and Fight Club and Snatch, I\\'m sure Brad has something in store for fans like me. Gwyneth Paltrow is probably the unsung hero, or heroine, of the film and ironically she\\'s the one who gets it worst (or does she? Refer back to tragedy point about sympathy). The words \\'never better\\' spring to mind when thinking about Paltrow\\'s \\'Tracey\\'. There\\'s someone else I\\'m not mentioning here, despite the \\'contains spoiler\\' tick, but let\\'s just say he/she/it provides, in my eyes, the greatest twist OF ALL TIME. Last but not least, David Fincher is where it\\'s at. His undoubtedly cool style is the reason why this film is so...cool, for want of a better word. Thanks to him, Morgan Freeman is cool, Gwyneth Paltrow is cool, the man who works in that horrible place where the \\'Pride\\' crime takes place is cool, even the man/woman/thing with no name is cool (to a certain extent). <br /><br />To conclude, there are certain films that when the credits appear at the end, you think to yourself \\'That has to be the best movie I\\'ve ever seen\\'. \\'Reservoir Dogs\\' and \\'L.A. Confidential\\' are prime examples. In my opinion, \\'Seven\\' epitomises this type of film.\"'],\n",

Also the scene where he tries to convince the soldier that he takes back home that being gay is not 7aram and that its 7allal.

       "  '\"This is a disturbing, bittersweet romantic comedy about two people who\\'s 15 year marriage is unraveling. Actually, it is more of a romantic tragedy than a comedy. Ben and Katie Jordan (Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer) are two mismatched people in the marriage that never should have been. He is spontaneous, romantic and impulsive, with low frustration tolerance and an explosive hair trigger temper. She is pragmatic, a compulsive perfectionist with unrealistic expectations, and a high need for control. She takes everything personally and never forgives or forgets a slight. They both blame each other for their disappointments. The pattern is clear. He doesn\\'t meet her standards so she snipes, he explodes and then she accuses him of not listening. She then throws up every mistake he\\'s ever made and every fault he\\'s ever had. This goes on ad nauseam as their romantic obsession with one another continues to get the best of any sense they might have to call it quits. Like moths to a flame, they keep returning for another scorching. <br /><br />This film is thought provoking in that it portrays marital difficulties that are all too familiar in our society. The problem is that it tries to give every problem known to man (with the exception of wife beating) to this couple and relies on the single strand of a long forgotten romance to be the only chance of keeping them together.<br /><br />In watching the behind the scenes featurette on this film, Rob Reiner and writers Alan Zweibel and Jessie Nelson discuss how the story evolved. As it turns out, it was a montage of all their own marital problems. So the film was, in essence cathartic dumping ground for the writers and director.<br /><br />As filmmaking, it was terrific. Rob Reiner weaves the story together expertly, creating a stark contrast between the joy of the romance and the reality of the relationship. The film was punctuated by numerous funny and sweet moments that make the viewer smile and glow with delight.<br /><br />Michelle Pfeiffer gives a splendid performance of a very emotionally complex and neurotic character. It took a lot of courage for her to take this part because she was playing the least likeable character in the film, something of a departure for her. Bruce Willis was as good as one could have expected considering the fact that nobody was blowing anything up. Actually, he was quite good as the impulsive, childlike romantic, but when it came to the arguments and the serious displays of resentment, he played the scenes too harshly, almost commando style.<br /><br />Reiner does good camera work and puts together some good rapid fire scenes that have impact and give great insight into the relationship. He also took the film on location in Venice to add a little romantic interlude, and somehow got Eric Clapton to write a great theme song.<br /><br />The problem is the story. Reiner stated in the featurette that he intended this to be a realistic bittersweet look at the real problems relationships face. But he tried to do too much and made this film a grossly exaggerated caricature of a relationship in crisis. It is really \\\\\"The War of The Roses\\\\\" lite only it takes itself too seriously. No one I know who saw this could believe that this couple could possibly have stayed married for 15 weeks, no less 15 years. <br /><br />The result is a noxious marathon of petty arguments that get under the viewers\\' skin after a while. It is about as entertaining as watching your best friends have a niggling argument in a public restaurant. The whole thing leaves you very uncomfortable and you don\\'t go home feeling like you\\'ve had a nice evening.<br /><br />So, while it succeeds as filmmaking, it fails as a film. I gave this film a 6/10. There were so many good elements to it that I can\\'t see trashing it. But the story is one that requires a level of emotional endurance that few viewers will be willing or able to invest to get any enjoyment out of it.<br /><br />\"'],\n",

It\\'s visually stunning, with an undeniably grandiose and epic quality, no doubt fueled by the superb performances.<br /><br />In fact, this is among the finest fantasy adventures created, rubbing shoulders with the likes of Conan the Barbarian and the Lord of the Rings (which was ironically what John Boorman initially intended to make). Some early and even a few debut performances grace the film, such as Liam Neeson, Gabriel Byrne, and Helen Mirren.<br /><br />Some have argued that the full plate armor donned by the knights is not \\\\\"historically accurate.\\\\\" Seeing as King Arthur is a legendary and/or mythical figure who may not have existed at all, this is not a terribly valid criticism. Furthermore, much of the myth surrounding King Arthur that many are familiar with comes from a work published in 1485 (Thomas Mallory\\'s Le Mort D\\'Arthur), a time when armor design was at its zenith and plate armor was common amongst those who could afford it, i.e. knights and other nobility.<br /><br />I really don\\'t have much criticism. I was not in the least bothered by the depiction of Arthur and his knights in full plate armor when engaged in battle. But it was more than a bit silly to see everything else from feasting to sex also portrayed in full armor. <br /><br />Such small issues did not detract from the splendor of the film.

       "  '\"This afternoon at the Barbican, I attended the UK premiere of the digitally restored \\'The Story of the Kelly Gang\\', with excellent piano accompaniment by John Sweeney, as part of the opening day\\'s programme for the Silent Film & Live Music Series running through June. It\\'s also part of the London Australian Film Festival, likewise at the Barbican ... so, I actually ended up attending two film festivals simultaneously! The restored film is a double-bill with \\'The Life Story of John Lee: The Man They Could Not Hang\\'.<br /><br />\\'The Story of the Kelly Gang\\' is generally believed to be (and most likely WAS) the first feature-length movie ever made, produced in 1906. Sadly, the past tense is appropriate here, as the film is now not known to survive except in fragments ... and some of those do indeed appear to be out-takes, as a previous IMDb\\'er has noted. Actually, I\\'ve also seen (in Australia) another reel of this film: not a projection of the movie\\'s image onto a screen, but rather I\\'ve seen (and touched) a mouldering reel of nitrate footage from the movie itself, now deteriorated beyond hope of restoration.<br /><br />As a part-time Australian (born in Scotland, expatriated Down Under as a \\'child migrant\\'), I ought to feel proud that Australia produced the first feature movie. However, quite enough films pre-dating 1906 survive (from various nations) to make it clear that a substantial amount of film technique -- the close-up, the dissolve, the cross-cut -- had already evolved before this movie was made. Watching this restoration at the Barbican, it occurred to me that credit for the single biggest innovation in \\'The Story of the Kelly Gang\\' belongs not to the photographer, director, editor or scenarist, but rather to that most unsung of film figures ... old Smokey, the projectionist. Prior to \\'The Story of the Kelly Gang\\', films were so short that it was possible to store two or more separate movies on one projection reel. And, each reel being a separate story, the breaks between reels were natural breaks in the narrative. Many early cinemas had only one projector, with live entertainment provided during the longeur while the previous reel was rewound before the next reel could be shown. However, when \\'The Story of the Kelly Gang\\' was exhibited in its original form in Australia (and later in other countries), the projectionist had to maintain two sets of apparatus at the same go, so as to achieve a seamless transition between reels. I wonder how soon film editors began using a reel marker (traditionally in the frame\\'s upper right-hand corner) to indicate that a reel was about to end.<br /><br />Despite being largely missing in action, the original \\'Story of the Kelly Gang\\' is of incalculable historic importance. As for the digital version which I enjoyed today, accompanied by Mr Sweeney\\'s impressive performance on the keyboard, I\\'ll rate it a full 10 out of 10. Bonzer, cobbers!\"'],\n",

Well, I\\'m not going to deny that, the subject matter would not look out of place in a soap opera. . . .however it is the performances, the script and the fantastic style of this movie which pulls it out of the mundane and into the cinematic. Michael Winterbottom is clearly a director who like several of his British contemporaries such as Mike Leigh and Shane Meadows, believes that the drama around us in everyday life is worthy of the big screen. The film has a fine ensemble of characters, three very different sisters, their estranged brother and squabbling parents. The performances are brave and heartfelt in all cases, and even though the drama takes place over one weekend, the characters really do evolve. The most enticing thing about the film is the way it is shot and scored. Sean Bobbitt\\'s time lapse photography and dogma style 16mm cinematography combined with Michael Nyman\\'s emotive music is a really fantastic combination. This film shows London how the people who live there see it, namely from the ground. Nearly every film set in London now seems to have to include the Gherkin, the Tate modern and the Millennium wheel, what Winterbottom presents us with is something simultaneously far less and far more remarkable.\"'],\n",

These two films, both with all black casts, showcase amazing talent often smothered by the then Hollywood studio system.

The classroom is made up of attentive black children asking some pretty intelligent questions about the Bible. We peek into one child\\'s view of heaven.

       "  '\"While not one of the three films in the collection of shorts put under the name \\\\\"Three Extremes\\\\\" will ever shock to the point of no return, they represent some of the sharpest wit, guts (literally and figuratively), and psychological insight into what really creeps out, entertains and sticks with us as viewers. The first is Fruit Chan\\'s Dumplings. This one had me intrigued on the outset because I had never seen a work of Chan\\'s before- he\\'s won many awards but is not as well-known a cult director as the his other contemporaries here- and by film\\'s end he had me for quite a loop. It\\'s surely the most depraved and intentionally \\\\\"oh-my-God\\\\\" type of short horror films one\\'s likely to see in the years to come, mainly because it takes on a very basic and over-done topic, vanity, and is cooked up (no pun intended) with human beings\\' attachment to new life. Mainly because, as Bai Ling\\'s character demonstrates, it\\'s so useful a old-age-prevention to eat aborted fetuses in dumpling form, as the main character, a former TV star who\\'s worried about being appealing to her husband. This probably has the least depth, emotionally and psychologically, of the three films, mainly because Chan is far more interested in getting the audience repulsed by what\\'s going on. It will certainly set the alarms going off for pro-lifers, but just about anyone will wonder how it can end like it does, with a twist that is just meant to add one more devilishly wretched twist on top of the baby-plate.<br /><br />Next up is Cut, a film by South Korea\\'s newest sensation Park Chanwook. While overall his film is the most wholly satisfying and entertaining, it\\'s not without a heap of \\'hip\\' shots, like the one that pulls back (via computers of course, though very cleverly) across the set of a movie being shot, or in some of those angles that one saw as being one-of-a-kind in Park\\'s Oldboy. This time a similar thread emerges: a true-blue psychopath, an extra with a grudge, makes psychological mind-games with a director with maybe too much humility to him, as his wife is tied up intricately with her fingers getting chopped off one by one. There\\'s a lot of real guilty-pleasure type laughs to be had here, with the black comedy reaching higher points than one would\\'ve expected even from Oldboy territory, where conscience gets thrown out the window and all that\\'s left are raw human emotions and the dark side of circumstance. It helps that the extra, played by Won Hie Lim, is great at the part because there\\'s no real sense of humor to him, but he still ends up being funny, like when he dances to that song from one of the Director\\'s films. The final five minutes of the short ratchets up the terror that\\'s been building up, and those looking for the same knock-out violent climax won\\'t be disappointed. But it\\'s the little moments too that Park gets right, as character, primarily the Director\\'s, is never a very certain thing.<br /><br />Takashi Miike\\'s Box is definitely, for my money, the best directed of the lot, or at least with the most measured for the characters in the story. This time the outrageousness of the previous shorts is replaced by a grim horror of complexes going back to childhood, of entrapment in the mind to memories that are too horrible to contemplate. An author seems to be revisiting things that happened as a child- the death of her sister by her own very strange accidental hands- and how a box figures its way into it all, on top of a very sick man- the girls\\' father- with a half-white face. Atmosphere this time trumps perversity, though it still applies that Miike\\'s film is a work that will be probably more haunting because of the complexities to how Kyoko faces what\\'s happened to her sister Soko. I won\\'t reveal what the final twist is, which is pure classic Miike, but the rest of the Box, which has very little dialog and many shots that linger longer than one might expect, is haunting and deliberately gut-wrenching. A circus atmosphere, of the sort here anyway, is no more or less realistic than the other scenarios portrayed in Three Extremes, but Box also has the upper-hand of reality blending with nightmares, and what nightmarish qualities always come up from them. What does the box mean? It\\'s not necessarily a MacGuffin, put it that way.<br /><br />So, if you make sure not to eat anything during the proceedings, and maybe have someone\\'s arm to clutch during some of the bloodier and gleefully sick moments, Three Extremes should make for a cool night of viewing. The directors on hand are in their A-game forms, and it has an appeal that might reach the more hard-bitten veterans of Asian cult films due to the ingenuity of key moments as well as newcomers to Asian horror that might draw them in ever more than before.\"'],\n",

I went into it pretty cold, not knowing exactly what to expect. The beginning of the film really grabbed me - the film was grainy, black and white, and the imagery was poetic and disturbing. This is the story of Estamira... sort of... I wont go into the detail of her life and what we see of it, because you can see that in the movie and read about it in the plot summary... some of the shots in this movie were spectacular... especially in the first half, and the final sequence in the water.. but there were points where her ranting and raving became almost painful to endure.. contradictory, angry, and occasionally insightful, Estamira is a rather unique and confusing person and her story is heartbreaking, although it is difficult to empathize given her temperament. I was hoping they would go into more detail with some of the other people featured in the film - mainly her friends at the landfill, but it was mainly dedicated to her. The main this I can say is that its a good film, but if they had have cut it down to about 45 minutes, it would have been superb. I\\'m looking forward to seeing what the director does next.\"'],\n",

Obviously this movie has absolutely nothing to do with Halloween, Michael Myers or Haddonfield and hopefully not too many people will be beguiled by this cheap marketing scam. I\\'m not even too sure \\\\\"Snapshot\\\\\" fully qualifies as horror, since the film barely features any genuine moments of fright. Despite the still relatively low number of independent cult movies produced in Australia around that time, \\\\\"Snapshot\\\\\" is an adequate and professional accomplishment with proper production values, respectable performances and ambitious story contents. Heck, the film is so ambitious that the drama overrules and the thriller elements never really even come through. \\\\\"Snapshot\\\\\" is much more of a satiric portrait of the sleazy and dishonest advertising/modeling industry than it is a nail-biting suspense thriller. Director Simon Wincer (\\\\\"Harlequin\\\\\", \\\\\"Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man\\\\\") seemingly never ceases to enlarge the melodramatic universe surrounding the main character Angela, but actually there\\'s very few action. 19-year-old Angela is lurid into shooting a topless modeling ad by an eloquent and she promptly gets offered a job as the face of a perfume brand.

She rapidly adapts to her new classy life and doesn\\'t even have to bother anymore about her stalking ex-boyfriend and his (not-so) inconspicuous ice cream van. However, she learns this is predominantly a rotten world full of greed, betrayal, false promises, sexual harassment, blackmail and danger. As said, \\\\\"Snapshot\\\\\" is a plain straightforward coming-of-age drama falsely advertised as a genuine horror movie. There are two noteworthy sequences near the very end, but they hardly seem worth waiting for.

The only thing going right for this movie, in spite of the script was the actor that played the lawyer/fiancé, otherwise the acting was non existent. The actor who played the lead was a little too old to be playing this type of \\\\\"dork\\\\\", he elicited no charm what-so ever, which was supposed to be the desired aim I suppose. An example being the sequence at the girls house after the first date to the bar, which was rather lame as far as the story and especially the acting goes. The actress who plays the lead was pretty, but was \\\\\"no actor\\\\\", the mother had the handicap of delivering bad dialogue, as did all the actors for that fact. The writing was \\\\\"sooo\\\\\" atrocious, I realize that screenwriters have a certain latitude when writing the story but, this story was pushing the envelope a wee bit too much: The mother starts in on a long diatribe on the matter of love the moment she meets the husband to be, also the cooking host on TV says this is a \\\\\"family show\\\\\" but continually uses the \\\\\"F\\\\\" word, or can you just imagine a man stalking a house in the bushes in broad daylight in an upscale neighborhood and all the neighbor could say was \\\\\"you asshole\\\\\", also how did they get the time to fix the truck and also not be seen, so it could stop on cue and how did Keeler get the time to get into the back of the van; where were the police and why was the couple moving themselves, don\\'t lawyers make any money in Florida?

It is NOT based on Janis Joplin\\'s life; it is NOT about a Janis Joplin-like character. The only similarity between the character Mary Rose Foster and Janis Joplin is that they were both female rock singers. The occupational hazard of drug and alcohol abuse is so ubiquitous in this genre that it can hardly be said to implicate Ms. Joplin as opposed to virtually any other female rock singer. Why no one says this movie is about Grace Slick, Stevie Nicks, or Joan Baez, I don\\'t know, but it bears no more resemblance to Janis Joplin than it does to any of these other women. Bette Midler\\'s \\\\\"Rose\\\\\" is truly an enormously talented woman, but she does not look, sound, dress, speak, act, sing or dance like Janis Joplin. Janis Joplin was not prone to getting into fights with people in public, stealing limousines, trespassing in steam baths, she was not from Florida, she was not asking to take a year off, she was not being manipulated by some evil Svengali manager, and she did not return to her home town to do one total blow out concert and subsequently drop dead on stage. I suppose it does not help that misinformed boobs like George Mair continue to perpetuate this nonsense in biographies of Ms. Midler, but no matter how frequently a fallacy is repeated or by how learned of an individual, it does not make it so. So to sum it up in plain English, THIS MOVIE IS NOT ABOUT JANIS JOPLIN.<br /><br />I think perhaps people are so eager to jump to this conclusion because without it, it is admittedly difficult to figure out exactly what this movie IS about. I\\'ll leave that question to subsequent reviewers who care to dig beyond the surface cliché that this movie is about Janis Joplin, which I believe we have now clearly established, it is not.

EXCEPT the boy doesn\\'t befriend him. He tries use him at first to get stuff, like good grades, and when the alien fails the alien is tortured, beaten, and thrown in the trash. For some reason, the alien returns to the boys home where he is further beaten and hit and thrown around. The alien decides to stay again. I am going to reveal the ending...The movie ends with the father being killed at an accident at work and the cute fuzzy alien thing sacrificing himself to resurrect the father. The only sense of the story I can make is that the creature was so despondent at being left in such a cruel miserable country he decided to kill himself by resurrecting the father. He resurrected the father because he wanted to punish him for being such a jerk by making him live longer at his sucky life as a poverty stricken coolie. <br /><br />And don\\'t worry, the boy gets beaten too. Great kids movie. Want to know why China is one of the worst offenders when it comes to animal cruelty? Here\\'s one reason why.<br /><br />Now I am no huge fan of Disney/Pixar/Dreamworks, but at least the messages in their movies have a beautiful sentiment behind them. You know, friendship is important, love is important, etc etc. The message in this movie seems to be you can treat non-human living beings as horrible as you want, use them, dispose of them, and you will still be their master. If this is what passes for children\\'s entertainment in China, then that is one messed up country.<br /><br />I should also mention, this movie is painfully unfunny. Most American kids movies have a lot of clever things to keep adults entertained along with the young ones. Like, for example, the use of Led Zeppelin\\'s Immigrant Song in Shriek III. There is none of that in this movie. It is extremely dumbed down. But it won\\'t work for kids either, as it can be upsetting to sensitive children.<br /><br />So, unless you are interested in a sociological examination of what constitutes a kid\\'s movie from China, stay far away from this one. Shaolin Soccer isn\\'t too bad though. I don\\'t know where all the positive reviews came from either. I think it must be astroturfing by people who work for the studio.\"'],\n",

Maybe i just want to get a certain insight into this guy who i thought was really cool in the eighties just to maybe make up my mind whether he is guilty or innocent. Moonwalker is part biography, part feature film which i remember going to see at the cinema when it was originally released. Some of it has subtle messages about MJ\\'s feeling towards the press and also the obvious message of drugs are bad m\\'kay.<br /><br />Visually impressive but of course this is all about Michael Jackson so unless you remotely like MJ in anyway then you are going to hate this and find it boring. Some may call MJ an egotist for consenting to the making of this movie BUT MJ and most of his fans would say that he made it for the fans which if true is really nice of him.<br /><br />The actual feature film bit when it finally starts is only on for 20 minutes or so excluding the Smooth Criminal sequence and Joe Pesci is convincing as a psychopathic all powerful drug lord. Why he wants MJ dead so bad is beyond me. Because MJ overheard his plans? Nah, Joe Pesci\\'s character ranted that he wanted people to know it is he who is supplying drugs etc so i dunno, maybe he just hates MJ\\'s music.<br /><br />Lots of cool things in this like MJ turning into a car and a robot and the whole Speed Demon sequence. Also, the director must have had the patience of a saint when it came to filming the kiddy Bad sequence as usually directors hate working with one kid let alone a whole bunch of them performing a complex dance scene.<br /><br />Bottom line, this movie is for people who like MJ on one level or another (which i think is most people). If not, then stay away. It does try and give off a wholesome message and ironically MJ\\'s bestest buddy in this movie is a girl! Michael Jackson is truly one of the most talented people ever to grace this planet but is he guilty?

In the theatre we sometimes have to piece out such imperfections with our thoughts, but I can\\'t think why Syberberg couldn\\'t splice in, for Parsifal and Gurnemanz, mountain pasture as lush as was provided for Julie Andrews in Sound of Music...<br /><br />The sound is hard to endure, the high voices and the trumpets in particular possessing an aural glare that adds another sort of fatigue to our impatience with the uninspired conducting and paralytic unfolding of the ritual. Someone in another review mentioned the 1951 Bayreuth recording, and Knappertsbusch, though his tempi are often very slow, had what Jordan altogether lacks, a sense of pulse, a feeling for the ebb and flow of the music -- and, after half a century, the orchestral sound in that set, in modern pressings, is still superior to this film.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"`The Matrix\\' was an exciting summer blockbuster that was visually fantastic but also curiously thought provoking in its `Twilight Zone\\'-ish manner. The general rule applies here- and this sequel doesn\\'t match up to its predecessor. Worse than that, it doesn\\'t even compare with it.<br /><br />`Reloaded\\' explodes onto the screen in the most un-professional fashion. In the opening few seconds the first impression is a generally good one as Trinity is shot in a dream. Immediately after that, the film nose-dives. After a disastrous first 45 minutes, it gradually gains momentum when they enter the Matrix and the Agent Smith battle takes place. But it loses itself all speed when it reaches the 14-minute car chase sequence and gets even worse at the big groan-worthy twist at the end. Worst of all is the overlong `Zion Rave\\' scene. Not only does it have absolutely nothing to do with the plot, but it\\'s also a pathetic excuse for porn and depressive dance music.<br /><br />The bullet-time aspect of `The Matrix\\' was a good addition, but in `\\'Reloaded\\' they overuse to make it seem boring. In the first one there were interesting plot turns, but here it is too linear to be remotely interesting. The movie is basically, just a series of stylish diversions that prevent us from realising just how empty it really is. It works on the incorrect principle that bigger is better. It appears that `The Matrix\\' franchise has quickly descended into the special effects drenched misfire that other franchises such as the `Star Wars\\' saga have.<br /><br />The acting standard is poor for the most part. The best character of course goes to Hugo Weaving\\'s `Agent Smith\\'- the only one to be slightly interesting. Keanu Reeves is the definitive Neo, but in all the special effects, there is little room to make much of an impact. Academy Award Nominee Laurence Fishburne is reduced to a monotonous mentor with poor dialogue. Carrie Ann Moss\\' part as the action chick could have been done much better by any other actress. <br /><br />A poor, thrown-together movie, `The Matrix Reloaded\\' is a disappointment. Those who didn\\'t like the first one are unlikely to flock to it. This one\\'s for die-hard fans only. Even in the movie\\'s own sub-genre of special effect bonanzas (Minority Report, The Matrix etc.) this is still rather poor. My IMDb rating: 4.5/10.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"Ulli Lommel\\'s 1980 film \\'The Boogey Man\\' is no classic, but it\\'s an above average low budget chiller that\\'s worth a look. The sequel, 1983s \\'Boogey Man II\\' is ultimately a waste of time, but at the very least it\\'s an entertaining one if not taken the least bit seriously. Now II left the door open for another sequel, and I for one wouldn\\'t have minded seeing at least one more. One day while I was browsing though the videos at a store in the mall I came across a film entitled \\'Return of the Boogey Man.\\' When I found out it was a sequel to the earlier films I was happy to shell out a few bucks for it...I should have known better. Though the opening title is \\'Boogey Man 3,\\' this is no sequel to those two far superior films I named above. Well, not totally anyway.<br /><br />Pros: Ha! That\\'s a laugh. Is there anything good about this hunk of cow dung? Let\\'s see...it has footage from \\'The Boogey Man\\' and, um...it\\'s mercifully short. Yeah, that\\'s about it.<br /><br />Cons: Where to start? Decisions, decisions. First of all, this movie is a total bore. It goes from one scene to the next without anything remotely interesting or scary happening. The acting is stiff at best. The \\\\\"actors\\\\\" are most likely friends of the director who had no acting experience whatsoever before, and probably none since. The plot is nonexistent and script shoddily written. The direction is just plain awful. The director tries to make the film look all artsy fartsy by making the camera move around, lights flicker, and with filters, but it adds nothing. The music is dull and hard to hear in parts. Ties to the original are botched. Suzanna Love\\'s character was named Lacey, not Natalie! And the events depicted in the beginning of the original did not take place in 1978. Also, if this has a 3 in the title, why is there no mention of what happened in II? Finally, this adds nothing new or interesting to either the series or the genre.<br /><br />Final thoughts: The people behind this waste of time and money should be ashamed of themselves. It\\'s one thing if that had been an original film that was the director\\'s first and sucked. But instead it\\'s supposed to be a sequel to film that is no masterpiece, but is damn sure far more interesting and entertaining than this. If there ever is another sequel, which I doubt it, then it needs to forget this one ever happened and be handled either by Lommel himself or someone who has at least some idea of how to make a decent horror film.<br /><br />My rating: 1/5\"'],\n",

Although flawed and a little dated, the apocalyptic touch and the environmental premise (typical for that time) still feel very unsettling and thought-provoking. This film\\'s quality-level surpasses the majority of contemporary SF flicks because of its strong cast and some intense sequences that I personally consider classic. The New York of 2022 is a depressing place to be alive, with over-population, unemployment, an unhealthy climate and the total scarcity of every vital food product. The only form of food available is synthetic and distributed by the Soylent company. Charlton Heston (in a great shape) plays a cop investigating the murder of one of Soylent\\'s most eminent executives and he stumbles upon scandals and dark secrets... The script is a little over-sentimental at times and the climax doesn\\'t really come as a big surprise, still the atmosphere is very tense and uncanny. The riot-sequence is truly grueling and easily one of the most macabre moments in 70\\'s cinema. Edward G.

He believes that when women actually have sex that\\'s when they lose any sense of \\\\\"innocence\\\\\" and/or \\\\\"beauty\\\\\". So he strolls through the Hollywood Hills stalking lovemaking couples at a distance, ultimately shooting the men dead with a high-powered rifle with a scope.<br /><br />The seeming primary reason for this movie\\'s existence is to indulge in sexual activity over and over again.

This is bound to make many a happily heterosexual male quite pleased as we\\'re treated to enough protracted scenes of nudity (the ladies here look awfully good sans clothes) and sex to serve as a major dose of titillation.

Cary Grant delivers more knock-about blows with his knuckled-up fists than he did in all of his movies put together. Set in faraway India, this six-fisted yarn dwells on the exploits of three rugged British sergeants and their native water bearer Gunga Din (Sam Jaffe) who contend with a bloodthirsty cult of murderous Indians called the Thuggee. Sergeant Archibald Cutter (Cary Grant of \\\\\"The Last Outpost\\\\\"), Sergeant MacChesney (Oscar-winner Victor McLaglen of \\\\\"The Informer\\\\\"), and Sergeant Ballantine (Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. of \\\\\"The Dawn Patrol\\\\\"), are a competitive trio of hard-drinking, hard-brawling, and fun-loving Alpha males whose years of frolic are about to become history because Ballantine plans to marry Emmy Stebbins (Joan Fontaine) and enter the tea business. Naturally, Cutter and MacChesney drum up assorted schemes to derail Ballentine\\'s plans. When their superiors order them back into action with Sgt. Bertie Higginbotham (Robert Coote of \\\\\"The Sheik Steps Out\\\\\"), Cutter and MacChesney drug Higginbotham so that he cannot accompany them and Ballantine has to replace him. Half of the fun here is watching the principals trying to outwit each other without hating themselves.

       "  '\"Intrigued by the synopsis (every gay video these days has a hunk on the cover; this is not necessarily to be construed as a good sign) I purchased BEN AND ARTHUR without knowing a thing about it. This is my second (and I assure you it will be my last) purchase of a CULTURE Q CONNECTION video. As far as I am concerned, this DVD is nothing but a blatant rip-off. I do not make this observation lightly \\x96 I am a major collector of videos, gay and mainstream, and I can state with some authority and without hesitation that BEN AND ARTHUR is quite simply the worst film I have ever sat through in my life. Period. My collection boasts over 1,600 films (93% on them on DVD) and of those, well over 300 are gay and lesbian themed. I hardly own every gay movie ever made, but I am comfortable in stating that I pretty much purchase almost every gay video of interest that gets released, and very often I buy videos without knowing anything about the film. Sometimes, this makes for a pleasant surprise - Aimee & Jaguar, It\\'s In The Water, Urbania and Normal are all examples of excellent gay titles that I stumbled upon accidentally. So when I read on the box that BEN AND ARTHUR concerned a conflict between gay lovers and the Christian Right, one of my favorite subjects, I decided to take the plunge sight unseen, despite my previously disappointing purchase of another CULTURE Q CONNECTION title, VISIONS OF SUGAR PLUMS. That film was pretty bad, but compared to BEN AND ARTHUR, it viewed like GONE WITH THE WIND. So what was so wrong with BEN AND ARTHUR? Plenty! To begin with, the \\\\\"plot\\\\\" such as it was, was totally ridiculous. This film almost made me sympathetic to the Christian Right \\x96 we are asked to believe not only that a church would expel a member because his brother is gay, but that a priest would actually set up a mob style execution of a gay couple in order to save their souls (like this even makes sense). The writing is so poor that many scenes make no sense at all, and several plot points reflect no logic, follow-up or connection to the story. Murder and violence seem to be acceptable ends to the gay activist / right wing conflict on both sides, and the acting is so bad that it\\'s difficult to imagine how anybody in this film got hired. The characters who are supposed to be straight are almost without exception clearly gay - and nelly stereotypes to boot; the gay characters are neither sexy nor interesting. This film is enough to put off anybody from buying gay themed videos forever, and the distributors should be ashamed of themselves. The only advantage this picture has over my other CULTURE Q Connection purchase, VISIONS OF SUGARPLAMS, is that this one has a soundtrack with clear dialogue. Hardly a distinction, since the script is so insipid that understanding the script only serves to make you more aware of how bad this film truly is. It is an embarrassment to Queer culture, and I intend to warn everyone I possibly can before they waste their money on it. At $9.95 this film would have been way overpriced; I understand that it\\'s soon to be re-priced under $20, which is STILL highway robbery. I paid the original price of $29.95, and I never felt more cheated in my life. The only true laugh connected with this drivel is the reviews \\x96 I have seen \\\\\"user reviews\\\\\" for this film on numerous websites, and there is always one or two that \\\\\"praise\\\\\" the director / writer / actor in such a way that it\\'s obvious that the reviewer is a friend of this Ed Wood wannabe.

Therefore, the beauty of the images in not achieved by the Brazilian viewer, if he has a chance to find this rare VHS in a rental or for sale. The film is practically a silent movie, the story is very dated and has only a few lines. Consequently, the characters are badly developed. However, this movie is also very daring, with the exposure of Hedy Lamarr beautiful breasts and naked fat body for the present standards of beauty. Another fantastic point is the poetic and metaphoric used of flowers, symbolizing the intercourse between Eva and her lover. The way the director conducts the scenes to show the needs and privation of Eva is very clear. The non-conclusive end is also very unusual for a 1933 movie.

This movie brought to mind the excellent movies that Branagh made with Emma Thompson. Carter\\'s star turn here as a disabled young women seeking to complete herself was as good a performance as I have seen from a female lead in a long time.

I will also avoid mentioning the spot-on satire `Office Space\\' in the same breath as this celluloid catastrophe. I can, however, compare it to waking up during your own surgery \\x96 it\\'s painful to watch and you wonder whether the surgeons really know what they\\'re doing. Haiku Tunnel is the kind of film you wish they\\'d pulled the plug on in its early stages of production. It was cruel to let it live and as a result, audiences around the world are being made to suffer.<br /><br />The film\\'s premise \\x96 if indeed it has one \\x96 is not even worth discussing, but for the sake of caution I will. Josh Kornbluth, a temp worker with severe commitment-phobia, is offered a permanent job. His main duty is to mail out 17 high priority letters for his boss. But ludicrously, he is unable to perform this simple task. My reaction? Big deal! That\\'s not a story\\x85 it\\'s a passing thought at best - one that should\\'ve passed any self-respecting filmmaker by. <br /><br />The leading actor \\x96 if you can call him that \\x96 is a clumsy buffoon of a man, with chubby features, a receding, untamed hairline, and a series of facial expressions that range from cringe-making to plain disturbing. Where o where did the director find this schmuck? What\\'s that you say\\x85\\x85 he is the director? Oh, my mistake. Playing yourself in your own embarrassment of a screenplay is one thing, but I suspect that Mr Kornbluth isn\\'t that convincing as a human being, let alone an actor. Rest assured, this is by no means an aimless character assassination, but never before have I been so riled up by an actor\\'s on-screen presence! My frustration was further confounded by his incessant to-camera monologues in between scenes. I mean, as if the viewer needs an ounce of intelligence to comprehend this drivel, Kornbluth insults us further by `explaining\\' the action (first rule of filmmaking: `dramatize exposition\\'\\x85 show, don\\'t tell). Who does this guy think he is? He has no charisma, no charm, and judging by his Hawaiian shirts, no sense of style. His casting agent should be shot point blank!<br /><br />The supporting actors do nothing to relieve the intense boredom I felt, with but one exception. Patricia Scanlon puts in a very funny appearance as Helen the ex-secretary, who has been driven insane by her old boss, and makes harassing phone calls from her basement, while holding a flashlight under her face. This did make me chuckle to myself, but the moment soon passed and I was back to checking my watch for the remainder of the film.<br /><br />The film\\'s title is also a misnomer. Haiku Tunnel has nothing to do with the ancient form of Japanese poetry. Don\\'t be fooled into thinking this is an art house film because of its pretentious-sounding title or the fact that it only played in a handful of cinemas and made no money at the box office\\x85\\x85\\x85 there\\'s a very good reason for that!<br /><br />\"'],\n",

That\\'s because although the film clearly was horror, some of the stories had a light spirit--and there were even occasionally a few laughs. This isn\\'t at all a bad thing as sometimes horror films are a bit stuffy and overly serious. Because of this and because all four of the stories were pretty good, it\\'s one of the better movies of this style I have seen.<br /><br />The unifying theme that connects each story is the house itself. Four different stories involve people who either rent the home or investigate what happened to the tenants.<br /><br />The first segment starred Denholm Elliott as a horror writer who has writer\\'s block. So, for a change of scenery, they rent this house. Almost immediately Elliott\\'s block vanishes and he works steadily on a tale about a serial killer. Amazingly, soon after his block vanishes he begins to actually see his fictional character! Again and again, the psychotic killer appears and then disappears--making it seem as if he is losing his mind. This might just be the best of the stories, as the nice twist ending makes the story come alive.<br /><br />The second, while not bad at all, is probably the weakest. Peter Cushing plays a bachelor who is pining for a girl friend who died some time ago (though the picture of her looked amazingly contemporary). When he enters a chamber of horrors wax museum in town, he sees a wax figure that reminds him of his lost lady and he is both fascinated and scared by this. Later, a friend (Joss Ackland) visits and he, too, sees the figure and is entranced by it. This all leads to an ending that, frankly, was a bit of a letdown.<br /><br />Christopher Lee then stars as an incredibly harsh and stern father to a pathetic little girl. During most of this segment, Lee seemed like an idiot, but in the end you can understand his demeanor. Though slow, this one ended very well.<br /><br />The fourth segment was the silliest and was meant to parody the genre. Jon Pertwee (the third \\\\\"Doctor\\\\\" from the DR. WHO television series) is a very temperamental actor known for his portrayals of Dracula. However, nothing is right about the film according to him and in a fit of pique, he stomps off the set to find better props for this vampire film. It\\'s actually pretty interesting that he played this role, as it seemed like a natural for Christopher Lee who played Dracula or other vampires a bazillion times (give or take a few). I enjoyed Pertwee\\'s line when he basically said that Lee\\'s and other recent incarnations of Dracula were all crap compared to Bela Lugosi\\'s! Perhaps this is why Lee didn\\'t take this part! Despite some very silly moments, it was very entertaining and fun--possibly as good or better than the first segment.<br /><br />Considering that the film started and ended so well, had excellent acting and writing, it\\'s hard not to like this film.\"'],\n",

Yes thats right, they use records in this movie. In one scene Eddie (Skippy) is listening to a message from the evil rockstar on his record player when things begin to get scary. Monsters start to come out of his speakers and his stereo becomes possessed. As a teenager I tried playing my records backwards hoping it would happen to mine. Almost 20 years later Trick Or Treat is still one of my all time favorite movies.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS (but not really - keep reading). Ahhh, there are so many reasons to become utterly addicted to this spoof gem that I won\\'t have room to list them all. The opening credits set the playful scene with kitsch late 1950s cartoon stills; an enchanting Peres \\'Prez\\' Prado mambo theme which appears to be curiously uncredited (but his grunts are unmistakable, and no-one else did them); and with familiar cast names, including Kathy Najimi a full year before she hit with Sister Acts 1 & 2 plus Teri Hatcher from TV\\'s Superman.<br /><br />Every scene is imbued with shallow injustices flung at various actors, actresses and producers in daytime TV. Peeking behind the careers of these people is all just an excuse for an old-fashioned, delicious farce. Robert Harling penned this riotous spoof that plays like an issue of MAD Magazine, but feels like a gift to us in the audience. Some of the cliched characters are a bit dim, but everyone is drizzling with high jealousy, especially against Celeste Talbert (Sally Field) who is the show\\'s perennial award-winning lead, nicknamed \\\\\"America\\'s Sweetheart\\\\\". The daytime Emmies-like awards opening does introduce us to Celeste\\'s show, The Sun Also Sets. Against all vain fears to the contrary, Celeste wins again. She is overjoyed, because it\\'s always \\\\\"such a genuine thrill\\\\\": \\\\\"Adam, did you watch? I won! Well, nguh...\\\\\" The reason for Adam\\'s absence soon becomes the justification for the entire plot, and we\\'re instantly off on a trip with Celeste\\'s neuroses. She cries, screeches, and wrings her hands though the rest of the movie while her dresser Tawnee (Kathy Najimi, constantly waddling after Celeste, unseen through Celeste\\'s fog of paranoia) indulges a taste for Tammy Faye Baker, for which Tawnee had been in fact specifically hired.<br /><br />Rosie Schwartz (Whoopi Goldberg) has seen it all before. She is the head writer of the show, and she and Celeste have been excellent support networks to each other for 15 years. So when Celeste freaks, Rosie offers to write her off the show for six months: \\\\\"We\\'ll just say that Maggie went to visit with the Dalai Lama.\\\\\" But Celeste has doubts: \\\\\"I thought that the Dalai Lama moved to LA.\\\\\" \\\\\"-Well, then, some other lama, Fernando Lamas, come on!\\\\\". Such a skewering line must be rather affronting to still living beefcake actor Lorenzo Lamas, son of aforementioned Fernando Lamas (d. 1982).<br /><br />Those who can remember the economics teacher (Ben Stein) in Ferris Bueller\\'s Day Off (1986) as he deadeningly calls the roll (\\\\\"Bueller. Bueller. Bueller\\\\\"), will take secret pleasure from seeing him again as a nitwit writer. Other well hidden member of the cast include Garry Marshall (in real life Mr Happy Days and brother of Penny), who \\\\\"gets paid $1.2 million to make the command decisions\\\\\" on The Sun Also Sets - he says he definitely likes \\\\\"peppy and cheap\\\\\"; and Carrie Fisher as Betsy Faye Sharon, who\\'s \\\\\"a bitch\\\\\".<br /><br />Geoffrey Anderson (Kevin Kline) is the \\\\\"yummy-with-a-spoon\\\\\" (and he is, by the way) dinner theater actor now rescued from his Hell by David Seaton Barnes (Robert Downey Jr), and brought back to the same show he was canned from 20 years earlier. Of course this presents some logical challenges for the current scriptwriters because his character, Rod Randall, was supposed to have been decapitated all those years ago. Somehow they work out the logical difficulties, and Geoffrey Anderson steps off the choo-choo.<br /><br />Celeste can now only get worse, and her trick of going across the Washington bridge no longer helps. First, her hands shake as she tries to put on mascara, but she soon degenerates into a stalker. Unfortunately, she cannot get rid of Geoffrey Anderson so easily. Geoffrey\\'s been promised development of his one-man play about Hamlet, and he means to hold the producer to that promise. \\\\\"I\\'m not going back to Florida no-how!\\\\\", argues Geoffrey. \\\\\"You try playing Willie Loman in front of a bunch of old farts eating meatloaf !\\\\\" And indeed, seeing Geoffrey\\'s dinner theater lifestyle amongst all the hocking and accidents is hilarious. Back in Florida in his Willie Loman fat suit in his room, Geoffrey Anderson used to chafe at being called to stage as \\\\\"Mr Loman\\\\\". He was forced to splat whatever cockroaches crawled across his TV with a shoe, and to use pliers instead of the broken analog channel changer. Now he find himself as the yummy surgeon dating Laurie Craven, the show\\'s new ingenue; so he\\'s not leaving.<br /><br />Beautiful Elizabeth Shue (as Laurie) rounds out the amazing ensemble cast who all do the fantastic job of those who know the stereotypes all too well. But, of course, the course to true love never did run smoothly. Montana Moorehead (Cathy Moriarty) is getting impatient waiting for her star to rise, and is getting desperate for some publicity.<br /><br />Will her plots finally succeed? Will Celeste settle her nerves, or will she kill Tawnee first? Will the producer get Mr Fuzzy? -You\\'ll just have to watch * the second half * of this utterly lovable, farcically malicious riot.<br /><br />And you\\'ll really have to see to believe how the short-sighted Geoffrey reads his lines without glasses live off the TelePrompter. If you are not in stitches with stomach-heaving laughter and tears pouring down your face, feel free to demand your money back for the video rental. Soapdish (1991) is an unmissable gem that you will need to see again and again, because it\\'s not often that a movie can deliver so amply with so many hilarious lines. This is very well-crafted humor, almost all of it in the writing. A draw with Blazing Saddles (1974) for uproarious apoplexy value, although otherwise dissimilar. Watch it and weep. A happy source for anyone\\'s video addiction. 10 out of 10.\"'],\n",

When a famous operatic performer sees and then befriends Wang, he invites Wang to join their troupe. However, we learn that Wang\\'s family tradition allows him only to pass his secrets to a son. Learning that Wang is childless, Wang is encouraged to find an heir before the magic is lost forever. Taking the advice to heart, Wang purchases an 8 year old to fulfill his legacy; he would teach his new son, Doggie, the ancient art of silk masks. Soon, Wang discovers a fact about Doggie that threatens the rare and dying art.<br /><br />Together, Wang and Doggie create a bond and experience the range of emotions that invariably accompany it.

Perhaps in the case of Lord of the Rings and Trainspotting, but it is a rare occurrence indeed. But I think that the fact that Louis Sachar was involved from the beginning helped masses, so that the film sticks close to the story but takes it even further. This film has many elements that make it what it is:<br /><br />1. A unique, original story with a good mix of fun and humour, but a mature edge. 2. Brilliant actors. Adults and kids alike, these actors know how to bring the story to life and deliver their lines with enthusiasm and style without going overboard, as sometimes happen with kids movies. 3. Breathtaking scenery. And it doesn\\'t matter if it\\'s real or CGI, the setting in itself is a masterpiece. I especially love the image of the holes from a birds eye view. 4. A talented director who breathes life into the book and turns it into technicolour genius. The transitions in time work well and capture the steady climax from the book, leading up to the twists throughout the film. 5. Louis Sachar! The guy who had me reading a book nonstop from start to finish so that I couldn\\'t put it down. He makes sure that the script sticks to the book, with new bits added in to make it even better. 6. And speaking of the script! The one-liners in this are smart, funny and unpatronising.

       "  '\"When I first saw the Romeo Division last spring my first reaction was BRILLIANT! However, on future viewings I was provided with much more than masterful film-making. This picture has a singular voice that will echo throughout the annuls of film history.<br /><br />The opening montage provides a splendid palette which helmer JP Sarro uses to establish his art on this canvas of entertainment.<br /><br />Sarro truly uses the camera as his paintbrush while he brings us along on a ride that envelops the audience in a tremendous action movie that goes beyond the traditional format we have become accustomed to and dives deeply into dark themes of betrayal, revenge and the importance of companionship. This movie is any director\\'s dream at its very core.<br /><br />However, Sarro was not alone in this epic undertaking. The writing, provided by scribe Tim Sheridan, was just as breathtaking.<br /><br />The dialogue was so precise and direct that it gave the actors such presence and charisma on the screen. Specifically speaking, the final scene (WARNING: SPOILERS!!! SPOILERS!!!) where Vanessa reveals herself to be one of the coalition and a villain all the time, is written in such a dark tone that it is one of the most chilling endings I have ever seen. Sheridan is the next Robert Towne.<br /><br />In a final note it is obvious that this production was no small feat.<br /><br />Therefore much praise must be given to producer Scott Shipley who seems to have the creativity and genius to walk next to Jerry Bruckheimer. Never before have I witnessed a production so grand with so much attention directed at every little detail. A producers job is one of the hardest in any movie and Shipley makes it look easy.<br /><br />All in all this film combines creative writing, stunning production and masterful direction. This is the art of film at its best. When the ending of the film arrives the only thing that is desired is more.<br /><br />The Romeo Division is groundbreaking, a masterpiece and, most importantly, The Romeo Division is indeed art.\"'],\n",

Bill finds out & is devastated, meanwhile Mary Lou is announced prom queen 1957 & takes to the stage to accept her award. Bill, still hurting, decides to play a practical joke on Mary Lou so he throws a firecracker on stage but the still lit fuse catches Mary Lou\\'s dress setting it & her on fire, within seconds Mary Lou is toast. 30 years later & Hamilton High is soon to hold it\\'s annual prom night. Bill (Micheal Ironside) is now the principal & has a teenage son named Craig (Justin Louis) who is dating Vicki Carpenter (Wendy Lyon) & are both planning on going to the prom together. Bud (Richard Monette) is now a priest, that terrible night 30 years ago still haunt both Bill & Bud. One day Vicki is looking around the schools basement when she discovers a large trunk which she opens, this turns out to be a bad move as the vengeful spirit of Mary Lou is set free & is intent on claiming her crown as prom queen & in her spare time sets out to avenge her untimely death. First up is Jess Browning (Beth Gondek) whose death is put down to a suicide, Mary Lou begins to posses Vicki\\'s body as the night of the prom draws nearer. After disposing of some competition in the shape of Kelly Hennenlotter (Terri Hawkes) who tries to fix the prom so she wins. Mary Lou in Vicki\\'s body is crowned Hamilton High prom queen which allows Mary Lou herself to come back from the dead to make an unexpected appearance & really liven the party up...<br /><br />With absolutely no connection to the original Prom Night (1980) & directed by Bruce Pittman I thought Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II wasn\\'t a particularly good film. The script by Ron Oliver concentrates more on supernatural elements rather than cheap teen slasher themes, whether this was a good or bad decision will depend on your expectations I suppose. Personally I found these different elements didn\\'t really gel or work that well together at all. The whole film was far to slow to be really enjoyable, after the opening sequence where Mary Lou dies no one else is killed until the half hour mark & then the film plods along for another half an hour until Vicki is finally possessed & the film finally picks up momentum for the climax where an evil Mary Lou kills a whole one person at the prom before she is supposedly defeated, come on horror film fans you did expect that clichéd \\'killer not dead & ready for a sequel\\' ending didn\\'t you? Don\\'t expect a hight body count, just five throughout the entire film & none particularly graphic although I did like the way Monica (Beverley Hendry as Beverly Hendry) tried to hide in a shower room locker which Mary Lou crushed & resulting in poor Monica\\'s blood oozing out. The supernatural side of Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II is depicted by Vicki having lots of hallucinations for the first hour & Mary Lou controlling objects during the latter stages including a couple of creepy shots of a rocking horse which comes to life, the blackboard scene is quite good as well as it turns into water & zombie hands drag Vicki into it. The slasher side of Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II isn\\'t outstanding, I did like Mary Lou herself as she churns out the obligatory one-liners & she made for a good villain even if she didn\\'t get to kill enough people. Oh, & yes I did get the running homages to various other horror film director\\'s with almost all of the character\\'s sharing last names with one, this obviously adds nothing to the film but is a nice little touch I suppose. The acting is OK but the normally dependable Micheal Ironside looks lost & uninterested almost as if he\\'s asking himself what he\\'s doing in this & if he\\'ll ever work again. Forget about any gore, someone is hanged, there is a stabbing with a crucifix that happens off screen, someone is impaled with a neon light, a computer goes crazy & electrocutes someones face(!?) & Mary Lou bursts out of Vicki\\'s body at first as a rotting zombie which was quite a cool scene. There are some full frontal nudity shots in the girls shower as well, if that\\'s your thing. To give it some credit Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II is OK to watch, has reasonable production values throughout & is generally well made. Overall I was disappointed by Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II, it was just too slow & ultimately uneventful to maintain my interest for nearly 100 minutes. I\\'m not sure whether it deserves a 3 or 4 star rating, I\\'ll give it a 4 as there\\'s nothing specifically wrong with it I suppose & I\\'ve sat through much worse films but it just didn\\'t really do anything for me I\\'m afraid.\"'],\n",

I came across it several times in various parts and always found it dark, bizarre and fascinating. I was young then, in my early teens; and now years later after having discovered the great Arliss Howard and being blown away by \\\\\"Big Bad Love\\\\\" I bought the DVD of \\\\\"Wilder Napalm\\\\\" and re-watched it with my girlfriend for the first time in many years. I absolutely loved it! I was really impressed and affected by it. There are so many dynamic fluid complexities and cleverness within the camera movements and cinematography; all of which perfectly gel with the intelligent, intense and immediate chemistry between the three leads, their story, the music and all the other actors as well. It\\'s truly \\\\\"Cinematic\\\\\".

And, Dennis Quaid in full clown make-up, sneakily introduced, angled, hidden and displayed by the shot selection and full bloomed delivery is of the kind of pure dark movie magic you don\\'t see very often. Quaid has always had a sinister quality to him for me anyways, with that huge slit mouth span, hiding behind his flicker eyes lying in wait to unleash itself as either mischievous charm or diabolical weirdness (here as both). Both Howard and Quaid have the insane fire behind the eyes to pull off their wonderful intense internal gunslinger square-offs in darkly cool fashion. In fact the whole film has a darkly cool energy and hip intensity. It\\'s really a fantastic film, put together by intelligence, imagination, agility and chemistry by all parties involved. I really cannot imagine how this got funded, and it looks pretty expensive to me, by such a conventional, imagination-less system, but I thank God films like this slip through the system every once in awhile. In a great way, with all of its day-glo bright carnival colors, hip intelligence, darkly warped truthful humor and enthralling chemistry it reminds me of one of my favorite films of all time: \\\\\"Grosse Pointe Blank\\\\\".......now that\\'s a compliment in my book!\"'],\n",

       "  '\"Zombie Review #3<br /><br />**Spoilers**<br /><br />Few films are actually \\\\\"so bad they\\'re good\\\\\", and Zombi 3 is not just bad, it\\'s wretchedly, unforgivably bad in so many ways that a whole new language may be needed just to describe them all<br /><br />More than that, it\\'s a film credited to Lucio Fulci that even by his standards has absolutely no coherency, sense or reason. However we can\\'t blame Fulci as it wasn\\'t really directed by him but by Bruno Mattei, who doesn\\'t even have Fulci\\'s sense of style to help carry the film. Mattei seems to have brought little to the film but staggering ineptitude.<br /><br />So, I\\'m ashamed to say how much I enjoyed every worthless minute of Zombi 3. It has no redeeming features - in a genre known for thin characters, weak story, and lack of film making skill, Zombi 3 pushes the boat out but in doing so it\\'s even funnier than Nightmare City.<br /><br />The \\\\\"action\\\\\" starts when the \\\\\"Death 1\\\\\" gas is stolen from a military base, and damaged in the escape. Who is the thief, why did he steal it, and why did the US military think that creating cannibalistic legions of the living dead would be a good idea? All these questions and more will fail to be answered in Zombi 3....<br /><br />After hiding out at a hotel, the infected thief goes mad from all the green plastecine growing on his face before being tracked down by the army who somewhat foolishly decide the best way to dispose of his corpse will be to burn it, sending \\\\\"Death 1\\\\\" up into the atmosphere resulting in... zombie birds! Who then attack people and turn them into zombie people!!! (if zombies are cannibals, why don\\'t the zombie birds just attack other birds?)<br /><br />Then we meet our \\\\\"heroes\\\\\", a trio of horny GIs and a coachload of girls. There\\'s a couple of other guys with them too, but they\\'re not important - NO ONE is important here. You\\'ll be hard pressed to remember anyone\\'s face, let alone their name or find a reason to care about them. They end up hiding out at the same hotel as the thief (\\\\\"a week ago this place was buzzing with life, now it\\'s buzzing with flies!\\\\\") but there\\'s no escape from the undead.<br /><br />By this point you\\'ll either be completely sucked in or you\\'ll have turned the damned thing off. The script is so appalling even the greatest acting in the world couldn\\'t save it, so it\\'s just as well they have some of the worst - and not just the human characters, the zombie acting here is an all time low. There\\'s no consistancy in how the zombies behave - some shamble about in the time honored style, others engage in full on fist fights or charge around with machettes, not to mention the zombies who are still able to talk (a gimmick that gives the film it\\'s HORRIFYING TWIST ENDING). They die from gunshots to the chest (rather than the head) and even get knocked out by a good left-hook. How can you punch out a zombie???!!!!! In fact the emphasis on badly done 80s action often makes it resemble an episode of V...<br /><br />The zombies also spend a lot of time hiding, seemingly waiting for hours in ridiculous places on the chance some poor sap will pass by and get the fright of their life. They hide in bushes, in garages, in huts, on roofs, in the water, and even underneath pregnant women. At one point a zombie follows a woman up the stairs. To kill and eat her? No! To push her into the water, those zombies and their wacky sense of humour!<br /><br />There is plenty of gore though. Limbs are hacked, wounds ooze green pus, and there\\'s much in the way of flesh eating and people getting their faces mushed in. There\\'s nothing to match the originals eyeball piercing, but if bad make up effects are your bag you won\\'t be let down.<br /><br />All this and I\\'ve not even mentioned the awful music, the inexplicable flying zombie head, the scientist whose acting actually manages to stand out as REALLY bad, or the final chilling punchline.... in an ingenious twist on the originals radio station being overrun by zombies, Zombi 3 gives us an actual zombie DJ!! \\\\\"He\\'s gone over to their side!\\\\\" our escaping hero\\'s cry, before vowing to continue fighting against the undead in a sequel that sadly never came.<br /><br />Zombi 3 is rubbish - it would be no loss to the world if every single print was destroyed and all records of it\\'s existence erased, yet somehow I feel my life is richer for having seen it.<br /><br />Did I say richer? I meant 88 minutes shorter...\"'],\n",

Whereas the Italian translation makes Ben\\'s plan something deeply human, characterized by human sympathy, the original one, though cultivated enough to remain unperceived by anyone, makes it, just in its reference to the flesh, something cold, rational, deep-rooted in the physical side of man. Unfortunately, I think that the real quality of Ben\\'s plan is revealed by the original title: it\\'a a cold machination, aimed at \\\\\"donating\\\\\" parts of his body, but lacking any authentic human empathy, at least the audience is not given the chance to see or perceive any pure relation of souls within the whole movie. The only exception is the love-story with the girl, which seems to be a sort of non-programmed incident, to which Ben yields, but incapable of conveying true emotional involvement. I really didn\\'t like the idea at the core of the movie: the idea that a person, however devoured by the pain for the death of his beloved and of other people he himself has caused, takes the resolute decision to expiate his sense of guilt through suicide: besides being improbable, it makes no sense. I would have liked, and I think it would have been more positive if, in the end, Ben had decided to abandon the idea of committing suicide and go on living, thus helping those same people, and maybe many more, just standing near them, and helping them through his presence. He wouldn\\'t have saved their lives miraculously, of course: this would have probably caused more suffering, but I think it could have been more constructive from a human, and moral point of view. There are many illogical and disturbing things: the initial reference to God\\'s creation in seven days (which, by the way, according to the Bible, are six!): what does it mean? And what about a woman suffering from heart-disease which prevents her from running and even from singing without feeling bad, who can have normal sex with a man who, feeling, as it should be, destroyed by the death of his wife and having donated organs and pieces of his body, doesn\\'t seem to feel so much tried, both emotionally and physically, from his impaired condition?

There are shots of teeming bats hanging from the ceilings of caves, swarming bats flying out of caves or swirling about near the mouths of caves. That alone is enough to be unsettling: Imagine all of them swarming after you? And they do indeed swarm in what should have been a show-stopper sequence that happened at about the forty minute mark, a downright inappropriately hilarious sequence where a teeming swarm of bats seem to attack a police car, splattering across the windshield like bloody broken eggs. The problem is that this sequence happens about fifty minutes too late to save the film, most of which consists of one or more people running around, screaming, waving their arms about at jabbering excitedly about some poor goofball who managed to get bitten by a bat during his vacation.<br /><br />The fear is that he is coming down with rabies, which does indeed suck, so their vacation is ruined, as the plot synopsis on the top of THE BAT PEOPLE\\'s reference page does indeed point out. So here is an effective summary of the movie: A young couple goes on a romantic getaway which is ruined when the guy is bitten by a bat. They bravely try to stick it out but he starts raving, trying to convince those around him that it\\'s a bit more involved than rabies, that he can\\'t control himself, and they everyone should KEEP AWAY.<br /><br />Now, when some one is frothing at the mouth, covered with sweat, eyes boggling about like one of the cheaper Muppets and screaming at you to GET AWAY FROM ME, you get away from him. You don\\'t try to give him drugs, you don\\'t try to tell him you love him, you give the guy his space, go home, and try that scenic getaway next year.<br /><br />But no, the people in this movie all behave like morons, insist on pushing the guy to his brink, and he flips out, mutates into a part man part bat type creature, and kills a bunch of non-essential secondary characters. Nothing wrong with that, but the movie forgets that it\\'s a low budget Creature Feature and tries to be some sort of psychological study. Instead of a monster movie, we get lots of people running around trying to get this guy to take a chill pill, and eventually he runs off into the hills looking very much more human than he should have, people insist on trying to chase him down and pay the expected price.<br /><br />The main thing wrong with the movie is that this should have happened in the first fifteen or twenty minutes, thirty tops, and the movie should have been about the guy AFTER he had turned into a Bat Person, rather than about the journey there. It takes a good eighty minutes to really pick up steam on that front, with some interesting character sketches along the way involving the always entertaining Michael Pataki as a small town cop who\\'s lost his moral edge, and the late Paul Carr as a physician friend who doesn\\'t quite get the message.<br /><br />The movie is dreadfully boring, about fifteen minutes too long and missed the opportunity to be a nice, forgettable little Creature Feature about a mutant run amok like the Italian horror favorite RATMAN, which I watched today and was sadly inspired to try this one after seeing. Me and my bright ideas, though the scene with the cop car was a howler: Too bad we couldn\\'t have had another twenty minutes of that.<br /><br />3/10\"'],\n",

It details the life of an 11 year old boy in a small town in Cuba in 1958 and 1959 during the revolution. Not much time is spent on the revolution until the very end, when the Socialist regime came and took the property of the boy\\'s father. The majority of the film is the boy\\'s coming of age and the relationships that arise in a small town where everyone knows everyone else. There are some powerful scenes that everyone can relate to. A class A film with fine acting and directing. This is a film that tells a story with no special effects or grand schemes or real twists.

       "  '\"I\\'m surprised at the comments from posters stating that Jane Powell made the same type of films Deanna Durbin did. Although they were both young sopranos whose film images were crafted by Joe Pasternak, if this film is any indication, they were almost polar opposites.<br /><br />While, in THREE SMART GIRLS, Durbin plays an impulsive \\\\\"Little Miss Fixit,\\\\\" who, after some setbacks, manages to reunite her divorced parents, in its\\' semi-remake, THREE DARING DAUGHTERS, Jane Powell almost destroys the marriage between her screen Mom Jeanette MacDonald and new stepfather Jose Iturbi when she refuses to accept him and strong arms her younger siblings into rejecting him, too. From the Durbin and Powell films I\\'ve seen, I\\'d say these disparate qualities permeate the early films of both of these talented young performers.<br /><br />As for Durbin\\'s performance in THREE SMART GIRLS, I find it completely winning, and most impressive. Although it\\'s clear from her occasionally shrill and over-emphatic line readings in some of the more energetic scenes that this is an early film for Deanna, watching the self-confident, knowing and naturally effervescent manner in which she delivers her lines and performs overall, and the subdued and tender manner she projects the more serious scenes, you\\'d never guess that this was the FIRST film role of a 14 year-old girl whose prior professional experience consisted almost exclusively of two years of vocal instruction. <br /><br />Given that this film, and Durbin herself, were much publicized at the time as \\\\\"Universal\\'s last chance,\\\\\" the production must have been an impossibly stressful situation for a film novice of any age, but you\\'d never know it from the ease and assurance Durbin displays on screen. Although she\\'s clearly still developing her acting style and demeanor before the camera (this was equally true of the early performances of much more experienced contemporaries like Garland, Rooney, O\\'Connor and Jane Powell), Durbin projects an extraordinary presence and warmth on camera that is absolutely unique to her, and, even here, in her first film, she manages to remain immensely likable despite the often quick-tempered impulsiveness of her character, and though she\\'s occasionally shrill, she never for a second projects the coy and arch qualities that afflicted many child stars, including Jane Powell and some of the other young sopranos who followed in the wake of her success.<br /><br />In short, like all great singing stars, Durbin was much more than just a \\\\\"beautiful voice.\\\\\" On the other hand, while Durbin\\'s pure lyric soprano is a truly remarkable and glorious instrument, the most remarkable thing about it, to me, was the way she is able to project her songs, without the slightest bit of affectation or \\\\\"grandnes\\\\\" that afflict the singing of adult opera singers like Lily Pons, Grace Moore and Jeanette MacDonald in films of the period<br /><br />The film is also delightful, heavily influenced by screwball comedy, it backs Durbin up with a creme-de-la-creme of first-class screwball pros such as Charles Winninger, Binnie Barnes, Alice Brady, Ray Milland and Mischa Auer. The story is light and entertaining. True, it\\'s hardly \\\\\"realistic,\\\\\" but why would anyone expect it to be? If you want :\\\\\"realistic\\\\\" rent THE GRAPES OF WRATH or TRIUMPH OF THE WILL. On the other hand, if you\\'re looking for a genuine, sweet, funny and entertaining family comedy with a wonderfully, charismatic and gifted adolescent \\\\\"lead,\\\\\" and terrific supporting players, this film won\\'t let you down.\"'],\n",

It\\'s a little more sluggish and drags a little slowly for such an exciting premise, and i think i\\'m seeing from the comments people having a love/hate relationship with this movie.<br /><br />However, if you look at this movie for what it is and not what it could have been considering the talent of the cast, i think it\\'s still pretty good. Julia Stiles is clearly the star, she\\'s so giddy and carefree that set among the conformity of everyone else, she just glows and the whole audience falls in love with her along with Lee. The rest of the cast, of course, Lee\\'s testosterone-filled coworkers, his elegant mother-in-law, his fratlike friend Jim and his bride-to-be all do an excellent job of fitting into stereotypes of conformity and boringness that make Stiles stand out in the first place. <br /><br />Lee doesn\\'t live up to his costars, i don\\'t think, but you could view that as more that they\\'re hard to live up to. Maybe that\\'s one source of disappointment.<br /><br />The movie itself, despite a bit of slowness and a few jokes that don\\'t come off as funny as the writer\\'s intended, is still pretty funny and I found a rather intelligent film. The themes of conformity and \\\\\"taking the safe route\\\\\" seemed to cleverly align on several layers. For example, there was the whole motif of how he would imagine scenarios but would never act on them until the last scene, or how he was listening to a radio program on the highway talking about how everyone conforms, or just how everything selma blair and julia stiles\\' characters said and did was echoed by those themes of one person being the safe choice and one being the risky choice.<br /><br />The other good thing about the movie was that it was kind of a screwball comedy in which Jason Lee has to keep lying his way through the movie and who through dumb luck (example: the pharmacy guy turning out to be a good chef) and some cleverness on his part gets away with it for the most part.<br /><br />While it wasn\\'t as funny as i expected and there was a little bit of squandered talent, but overall it\\'s still a good movie.\"'],\n",

In this Muslim culture, where men have always been sovereign over women, according to Sharia law, one can well imagine the difficulty of imposing secular legal rights for women and children. After 17 years of failed efforts, leaders of the WLA began recently to score a few wins, and the purpose of this film is to share these victorious stories.<br /><br />The leaders of this legal reform movement are Vera Ngassa, a state prosecutor, and Beatrice Ntuba, a senior judge (Court President). Both play themselves in this film, which may contain footage shot spontaneously, though I imagine much of it, if not all, consists of subsequent recreations of real events for the camera. Four cases are reviewed, and all of the plaintiffs also play themselves in the film.<br /><br />Two cases involve repeated wife beating, with forcible sex in one case; another involves forced sex upon a 10 year old girl; and yet another concerns the repeated beatings of a child, age 8, by an aunt. One of the beaten wives also is seeking a divorce. We follow the cases from the investigation of complaints to the outcomes of the trials. The outcomes in each case are favorable to the women and children. The perpetrators receive stiff prison terms and/or fines; the divorce is granted.<br /><br />The aggressive prosecution of the child beating aunt demonstrates that these female criminal justice officials are indeed gender-neutral when it comes to enforcing the law. Also noteworthy is the respect with which all parties, including those found guilty, are treated. This is a highly important and well made film.

The first part of the film, when war comes to Everytown, is short but powerful. (Ironically, film audiences in its release year laughed at reports that enemy planes were attacking England--appeasement was at its height. Wells\\' prediction was borne out all too soon.) The montage of endless war that follows, while marred by sub-par model work, is most effective. The explanatory titles are strongly reminiscent of German Expressionist graphic design. The art director was the great William Cameron Menzies, and his sets of the ruins of Everytown are among his best work. Margaretta Scott is very seductive as the Chief\\'s mistress. The Everytown of the 21st century is an equally striking design. The acting in the 21st century story is not compelling--perhaps this was a misfired attempt to contrast the technocratic rationality of this time with the barbarism of 1970. Unfortunately, the model work, representing angry crowds rushing down elevated walkways, is laughably bad and could have been done much better, even with 30s technology. This is particularly galling since the scenes of the giant aircraft are very convincing. This is redeemed by Raymond Massey\\'s magnificent speech that concludes the film--rarely has the ideal of scientific progress been expressed so well. Massey\\'s final question is more relevant now than ever, in an era of severely curtailed manned spaceflight. The scene is aided by the stirring music of Sir Arthur Bliss, whose last name I proudly share.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the VHS versions of this film are absolutely horrible, with serious technical problems. Most versions have edited out a rather interesting montage of futuristic workers and machines that takes us from 1970 to 2038. I hope a good DVD exists of the entire film.\"'],\n",

Overall \\\\\"Twilight Zone\\\\\" is certainly one of the true classics in television, and given its production during the height of the Cold War period, provides not only a view of this era in the country, but also (today) a nostalgic picture of production techniques, creative viewpoints and the actors of this era several decades ago.<br /><br />* Minor \\\\\"spoiler.\\\\\"*<br /><br />This particular story depicts, as did other presentations in this series and elsewhere, a story where the locale is meant to provide a \\\\\"surprise\\\\\" ending. Sometimes the characters are on earth, from elsewhere, while the story at first implies at least one is an \\\\\"Earthling.\\\\\" These usually contained the message (as here) of a situation prompted by the doomsday buttons having finally been pressed by the super powers during this Cold War period.<br /><br />Viewed today, stories like this one provide a nostalgic look at this worldly viewpoint 4-5 decades ago, and still provide some food-for-thought. -- as did this episode.<br /><br />While the dialog may not have stretched the considerable talents of the leads, it still presents a simple, important message, and a worthwhile 20-some minutes of entertainment and interest.\"'],\n",

And while it was not Gainax\\'s first animated product, it was their first OVA series.<br /><br />Mainly starting out as a parody of the 1970\\'s sports drama Aim For The Ace (Ace O Nerae!), Gunbuster picks up steam as a serious drama toward the ending of episode 2, when Noriko Takaya is forced to relive the death of her father, who was killed in mankind\\'s initial encounter with the insect race Humanity is at war with. It is because of her father\\'s death that Noriko wants to become a combat pilot. But her lack of confidence proves to get in the way at times and she falters. Her friend, Kazumi Amano, even has doubts about Noriko being chosen as a pilot. However, Noriko\\'s coach, Koichiro Ota, has faith in her. And he has made it his personal mission to see that she succeeds at becoming a pilot, for he was a survivor of the battle in which Noriko\\'s father was killed.<br /><br />Other characters include Jung-Freud, a Russian combat pilot assigned to serve with the squadron Noriko and Kazumi belong to, Smith Toren, a love interest for Noriko who is killed in their first sortie together, and Kimiko Higuchi, Noriko\\'s childhood friend. Kimiko\\'s involvement is also of interest, as while Noriko is off in space, Kimiko remains behind on Earth to live a normal life. And because of the acts of time dilation, Kimiko ages normally on Earth while Noriko is relatively the same age as when she left school. By the end of the series, Noriko is roughly 18 years old while Kimiko is in her mid-fifties.<br /><br />All in all, this is an excellent anime series to watch if you are a fan of giant robot mecha and of Gainax animation. If you like Hideaki Anno\\'s other shows, or are a fan of Haruhiko Mikimoto\\'s artwork, then give this show a chance. It will grow on you.\"'],\n",

The vast majority of Public Schools took their pupils from lower down the social scale.Tom Brown,perhaps the most famous Public School pupil ever,was the son of a country parson,not a belted earl. Thus in late 1960s England,a country in the throes of post-colonial guilt and shedding the last of its commitments to its former dependants as quickly as Harold Wilson could slip off his \\\\\"Gannex\\\\\" mac,Lindsay Anderson\\'s \\\\\"If\\\\\" was greeted with cathartic joy by the chattering classes and mild bemusement by everyone else. It must be remembered that the so-called \\\\\"summer of love\\\\\" was followed by the \\\\\"October Revolution\\\\\" a non-event that left a few policemen in London with bruised heads and the U.S. Embassy with one or two broken windows,but achieved absolutely nothing. So when Mr Anderson\\'s film reached the cinemas the disgruntled former revolutionaries revelled vicariously in what they saw as Mr Malcolm McDowell\\'s glorious victory over an amorphous \\\\\"Them\\\\\" despite the fact that he was ruthlessly gunned down at the end,a fate that would have undoubtedly overtaken them had they succeeded in their attempts to get into the U.S.Embassy.

Graham Greene has been translated into film many times of course, in such masterpieces as \\\\\"Thin Man\\\\\" and in lesser vehicles. \\\\\"Confidential Agent\\\\\" is one of those lesser vehicles, yet it manages to get me somewhere anyway, despite lackluster direction, the incongruity of Bacall and Boyer\\'s depictions as (respectively) British and Spanish, and the almost complete non-existence of any chemistry between the two leads. In some ways, this last \\\\\"problem\\\\\" actually begins to work in the film\\'s favor, for how can love really blossom in the killing atmosphere of fascism and capitalism meeting about one person\\'s tragedy? The most compelling aspect of the film arises directly from Greene\\'s complex and guilt-ridden psychology, which pervades the film. I know some see the deliberate pacing here as dull, and I can understand that. Yet I found that plodding accentuated rather than detracted from what is a claustrophobic world. I was compelled to watch, not by any great acting (although Boyer is marvelous as usual, managing to convey a rich mixture of world-weariness, tragedy, hope, and fervor with his magnificent voice and yearning eyes), but by the down-spiraling rush of one man\\'s slim hopes against a world of oppression and money. What is a thief? What good is love in the face of death? Where does mere profit-taking end and exploitation begin? The film does not rise to the level of art, and thus cannot hope to answer such questions, but it is much more than mere entertainment, and its murders and guilts are very grimly drawn.

       "  '\"Title: Zombie 3 (1988) <br /><br />Directors: Mostly Lucio Fulci, but also Claudio Fragasso and Bruno Mattei <br /><br />Cast: Ottaviano DellAcqua, Massimo Vani, Beatrice Ring, Deran Serafin <br /><br />Review: <br /><br />To review this flick and get some good background of it, I gotta start by the beginning. And the beginning of this is really George Romeros Dawn of the Dead. When Dawn came out in 79, Lucio Fulci decided to make an indirect sequel to it and call it Zombie 2. That film is the one we know as plain ole Zombie. You know the one in which the zombie fights with the shark! OK so, after that flick (named Zombie 2 in Italy) came out and made a huge chunk of cash, the Italians decided, heck. Lets make some more zombie flicks! These things are raking in the dough! So Zombie 3 was born. Confused yet? The story on this one is really just a rehash of stories we\\'ve seen in a lot of American zombie flicks that we have seen before this one, the best comparison that comes to mind is Return of the Living Dead. Lets see...there\\'s the government making experiments with a certain toxic gas that will turn people into zombies. Canister gets released into the general population and shebang! We get loads of zombies yearning for human flesh. A bunch of people start running away from the zombies and end up in an old abandoned hotel. They gotta fight the zombies to survive.<br /><br />There was a lot of trouble during the filming of this movie. First and foremost, Lucio Fulci the beloved godfather of gore from Italy was sick. So he couldn\\'t really finish this film the way that he wanted to. The film was then handed down to two lesser directors Bruno Mattei (Hell of the Living Dead) and Claudio Fragasso (Zombie 4). They did their best to spice up a film that was already not so good. You see Fulci himself didn\\'t really have his heart and soul on this flick. He was disenchanted with it. He gave the flick over to the producers and basically said: \\\\\"Do whatever the hell you want with it!\\\\\" And god love them, they did.<br /><br />And that is why ladies and gents we have such a crappy zombie flick with the great Fulci credited as its \\\\\"director\\\\\". The main problem in my opinion is that its just such a pointless bore! There\\'s no substance to it whatsoever! After the first few minutes in which some terrorists steal the toxic gas and accidentally release it, the rest of the flick is just a bunch of empty soulless characters with no personality whatsoever running from the zombies. Now in some cases this can prove to be fun, if #1 the zombie make up and zombie action is actually good and fun and #2 there\\'s a lot of gore and guts involved.<br /><br />Here we get neither! Well there\\'s some inspired moments in there, like for example when some eagles get infected by the gas and they start attacking people. That was cool. There\\'s also a scene involving a flying zombie head (wich by the way defies all logic and explanation) and a scene with zombies coming out of the pool of the abandoned hotel and munching off a poor girls legs. But aside from that...the rest of the flick just falls flat on its ass.<br /><br />Endless upon endless scenes that don\\'t do jack to move the already non existent plot along. That was my main gripe with this flick. The sets look unfinished and the art direction is practically non-existent. I hate it when everything looks so damn unfinished! I like my b-movies, but this one just really went even below that! Its closer to a z-level flick, if you ask me.<br /><br />The zombie make up? Pure crap. The zombies are all Asian actors (the movie was filmed in the Philippines) so you get a bunch of Asian looking zombies. But thats not a big problem since they movie was set in the phillipine islands anyway. Its the look of the zombies that really sucks! They all died with the same clothes on for some reason. And what passes for zombie make up here is a bunch of black make up (more like smudges) on their faces. One or two zombies had slightly more complex make up, but it still wasn\\'t good enough to impress. Its just a bunch of goo pointlessly splattered on the actors faces. So not only is this flick slowly paced but the zombies look like crap. These are supposed to be dead folks! Anyhows, for those expecting the usual coolness in a Fulci flick don\\'t come expecting it here cause this is mostly somebody else\\'s flick. And those two involved (Mattei and Fragasso) didn\\'t really put there heart and souls into it. In fact, when you see the extras on the DVD you will see that when Fragasso is asked about his recollections and his feelings on this here flick, he doesn\\'t even take it to seriously. You can tell he is ashamed of it and in many occasions he says they \\\\\"just had a job to do and they did it\\\\\". And that my friends, is the last nail on this flick. There\\'s no love, and no heart put into making this film. Therefore you get a half assed, crappy zombie flick.<br /><br />Only for completest or people who want to have or see every zombie flick ever made. Everybody else, don\\'t even bother!

       "  '\"This one came out during the Western genre’s last gasp; unfortunately, it emerges to be a very minor and altogether unsatisfactory effort – even if made by and with veterans in the field! To begin with, the plot offers nothing remotely new: James Coburn escapes from a chain gang, intent on killing the man (now retired) who put him there – Charlton Heston. While the latter lays a trap for him, Coburn outwits Heston by kidnapping his daughter (Barbara Hershey). Naturally, the former lawman – accompanied by Hershey’s greenhorn fiancé (Chris Mitchum) – sets out in pursuit of Coburn and his followers, all of whom broke jail along with him.<br /><br />Rather than handling the proceedings in his customary sub-Fordian style, McLaglen goes for a Sam Peckinpah approach – with which he’s never fully at ease: repellent characters, plenty of violence, and the sexual tension generated by Hershey’s presence among Coburn’s lusty bunch. Incidentally, Heston and Coburn had previously appeared together in a Sam Peckinpah Western – the troubled MAJOR DUNDEE (1965; I really need to pick up the restored edition of this one on DVD, though I recently taped the theatrical version in pan-and-scan format off TCM UK). Anyway, the film is too generic to yield the elegiac mood it clearly strives for (suggested also by the title): then again, both stars had already paid a fitting valediction to this most American of genres – WILL PENNY (1968) for Heston and Coburn with PAT GARRETT & BILLY THE KID (1973)! <br /><br />At least, though, Heston maintains a modicum of dignity here – his ageing character attempting to stay ahead of half-breed Coburn by anticipating what his next move will be; the latter, however, tackles an uncommonly brutish role and only really comes into his own at the climax (relishing his moment of vengeance by sadistically forcing Heston to witness his associates’ gang-rape of Hershey). Apart from the latter, this lengthy sequence sees Heston try to fool Coburn with a trick borrowed from his own EL CID (1961), the villainous gang is then trapped inside a bushfire ignited by the practiced Heston and the violent death of the two ‘obsolete’ protagonists (as was his fashion, Heston’s demise takes the form of a gratuitous sacrifice!).<br /><br />The supporting cast includes Michael Parks as the ineffectual town sheriff, Jorge Rivero as Coburn’s Mexican lieutenant, and Larry Wilcox – of the TV series CHiPs! – as the youngest member of Coburn’s gang who’s assigned the task of watching over Hershey (while doing his best to keep his drooling mates away!). Jerry Goldsmith contributes a flavorful but, at the same time, unremarkable score.\"'],\n",

No A-list actor outside of this film would risk sharing the same billing as him for all the humiliation this film is bound to carry with it.<br /><br />But lets not just blame the director here, there is the cinematographer, who looks like he\\'s rehearsing for the amateur home movie maker of the year award.

The lighting man, who must have been holding a cigarette in one hand and light bulb on pole in the other, and hoping that the flame burning off the cigarette would add to that much needed light in every scene. And, of course the actors! Some of them are by no means newcomers, else all could be forgiven here. The ensemble of actors in Aag were put together to promote a new beginning and dimension to the re-make of India\\'s most loved movie of all time, \\'Sholay\\'.

I found it difficult to sit still through all the contrived metaphors, parallels and biblical references, and impossible to accept bathed-in-light Ian Hunter\\'s smug know-it-all as a Christ figure.

       "  '\"Being a music student myself, I thought a movie taking place in a conservatory might be fun to watch. Little did I know... (I had no idea this movie was based on a book by Britney Spears) This movie was implausible throughout. It\\'s obvious that whoever wrote the script never set foot in a conservatory and doesn\\'t know a thing about classical music. Let me give you just a few examples: 1) There is NO WAY anyone would be admitted to a classical conservatory with no classical training whatsoever! Just having a nice pop voice isn\\'t enough, besides, that\\'s a different thing altogether - another genre, different technique. It\\'s like playing the violin when applying for a viola class. 2) How come the lady teaching music theory was in the singing jury? If she wasn\\'t a singing professor herself, she would have no say in a situation like that, and if she was a singing professor, why weren\\'t we told so? 3) Being able to read music is a necessity if you\\'re to major in music. 4) How did Angela get a hold of that video tape? That would have been kept confidential, for the jury\\'s eyes only. Now either she got the tape from one of the professors or the script writers just didn\\'t have a clue. I wonder which... 5) The singing professor gave Holly the Carmen song saying she \\\\\"had the range\\\\\", which she clearly did NOT. Yes, she was able to sing the notes, but Carmen is a mezzo-soprano, while Holly\\'s voice seemed to be much lighter in timbre, not at all compatible with that song. 6) Worst of all: Not only does the movie show a shocking ignorance when it comes to classical music, but it doesn\\'t even try to hide it. The aria that Angela sings is mutilated beyond recognition, a fact which is painfully blatant at the recital, where it is cut short in a disgraceful way - Mozart would roll over in his grave. The Habanera from Carmen sounded a bit weird at times, too, and the way it was rearranged at the end just shows how little the producers really think of classical music - it\\'s stiff and boring but hey, add some drums and electric guitars and it\\'s almost as good as Britney Spears! I know these are all minor details, but it would have been so easy to avoid them with just a little research. Anyhow, I might have chosen to suspend my disbelief had the characters and the plot been well elaborated. But without that, I really can\\'t find any redeeming qualities in this movie except for one: it\\'s good for a laugh.\"'],\n",

I\\'ve seen several reviewers call ISOYG an \\'anti-rape\\' film or even a feminist statement, and I just have to chime in on the galling hypocrisy of these claims.<br /><br />First of all, what do we see on the cover of this movie? That\\'s right: a shapely woman\\'s behind. Whether it was Zarchi\\'s attempt to make an anti-rape statement - and I absolutely don\\'t believe it was - is entirely beside the point. The film is marketing sex and the titillation of sexual assault and the material is so graphic (everything but actual penetration is shown) that NO ONE but the hard core exploitation crowd will enjoy it.<br /><br />The rape(s) in the film is uncomfortable, brutal and hard to watch. There\\'s something to be said for presenting a horrible crime in such a brutal light, but there was no reason for this scene to go on for seemingly 30 minutes, none. There was also little character development of the victim and only one of the rapists is slightly developed (mere moments before he\\'s murdered) so the scene isn\\'t at all engaging on an emotional level. Really, it\\'s just presented for the sake of showing extreme sexual violence and you can tell by the movies ISOYG is associated with on IMDb (Caligula, Cannibal Ferox, etc.) that it attracts only the exploitation crowd.<br /><br />Finally, a few reviewers have commended Zarchi\\'s so-called documentary style and lack of a soundtrack. But considering how inept everything else in the film is (acting, script, etc.) I suspect these were financial decisions and the film looks like a documentary because he literally stationed a camera and let his porn-caliber actors do their thing.<br /><br />I\\'m not going to get all up on my high horse talking about the content of ISOYG. I\\'m all for exploitation / horror and love video nasties. In fact, I\\'m giving this movie three stars only because it truly does push the envelope so much further than some other films. However, it\\'s also poorly made and after the rape occurs, just downright boring for the rest of the film as we watch a bunch of ho-hum, mostly gore-less murders and wait for the credits to roll.<br /><br />This is probably worth watching once if you\\'re a hardcore 70s exploitation fan but I\\'m telling you, the movie is overall pretty bad and not really worth its notorious reputation.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"This was the first PPV in a new era for the WWE as Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior, Ric Flair and Sherri Martel had all left. A new crop of talent needed to be pushed. And this all started with Lex Luger, a former NWA World Heavyweight Champion being given a title shot against Yokozuna. Lex travelled all over the US in a bus called the Lex Express to inspire Americans into rallying behind him in his bid to beat the Japanese monster (who was actually Samoan) and get the WWE Championship back into American hands. As such there was much anticipation for this match.<br /><br />But every good PPV needs an undercard and this had some good stuff.<br /><br />The night started off with Razor Ramon defeating Ted DiBiase in a good match. The story going into this was that DiBiase had picked on Ramon and even offered him a job as a slave after his shock loss to the 1-2-3 Kid on RAW in July. Ramon, angry, had then teamed with the 1-2-3 Kid against the Money Inc tag team of Ted DiBiase and Irwin R Shyster. To settle their differences they were both given one on one matches DiBiase vs Ramon and Shyster vs The Kid. Razor was able to settle his side of the deal after hitting a Razor\\'s Edge.<br /><br />Next up came the Steiner Brothers putting the WWE Tag Team Titles on the line against The Heavenly Bodies. Depsite the interference of \\\\\"The Bodies\\\\\" Manager Jim Cornette, who hit Scott Steiner in the throat with a tennis racket, they were able to pull out the win in a decent match.<br /><br />Shawn Michaels and Mr Perfect had been feuding since Wrestlemania IX when Shawn Michaels confronted Perfect after his loss to Lex Luger. Perfect had then cost Michaels the Intercontinental Championship when he distracted him in a title match against Marty Janetty. Michaels had won the title back and was putting it on the line against Mr Perfect, but Michaels now had a powerful ally in his corner in his 7 foot bodyguard Diesel. Micheals and Perfect had an excellent match here, but it was Diesel who proved the difference maker, pulling Perfect out of the ring and throwing him into the steel steps for Shawn to win by count out.<br /><br />Irwin R Shyster avenged the loss of his tag team partner earlier in the night, easily accounting for the 1-2-3 Kid.<br /><br />Next came one of the big matches of the night as Bret Hart prepared to battle Jerry Lawler for the title of undisputed King of the WWE. But Lawler came out with crutches, saying he\\'d been injured in a car accident earlier that day and that he\\'d arranged another opponent for Hart: Doink the Clown. Hart and Doink had a passable match which Hart won with a sharpshooter. He was then jumped from behind by Lawler. This bought WWE President Jack Tunney to the ring who told Lawler that he would receive a lifetime ban if he didn\\'t wrestle Hart. Hart then destroyed Lawler, winning with the sharpshooter, but Hart refused to let go of the hold and the referee reversed his decision. So after all that Lawler was named the undisputed King of the WWE. This match was followed by Ludvig Borda destroying Marty Janetty in a short match.<br /><br />The Undertaker finished his long rivalry with Harvey Wippleman, which had started in 1992 when the Undertaker had defeated Wippleman\\'s client Kamala at Summerslam and continued when Wippleman\\'s latest monster The Giant Gonzales had destroyed Taker at the Rumble and then again at Wrestlemania, with a decisive victory over Gonzales here. Gonzales then turned on Wippleman, chokeslamming him after a poor match.<br /><br />Next it was time for six man tag action as the Smoking Gunns (Bart and BIlly) and Tatanka defeated The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu) and Bam Bam Bigelow with Tatanka pinning Samu.<br /><br />This brings us to the main event with Yokozuna, flanked by Jim Cornette and Mr Fuji, putting the WWE Title on the line against Lex Luger and it was all on board the Lex Express. Lex came out attacking, but Yokozuna took control. Lex came back though as he was able to avoid a banzai drop and then body slam Yokozuna before knocking him out of the ring. Luger then attacked Cornette and Fuji as Yokozuna was counted out. Luger had won a fine match!!!!! Balloons fell from the ceiling. The heroes all came out to congratulate him on his win. Yokozuna may have retained the title, but Luger had proved he could be beaten. The only question was, who could beat him in the ring and get that title off him?\"'],\n",

This last work of Dutch director Paul Verhoeven in his home country before he moved to Hollywood to become a big star with movies like \\\\\"Total Recall\\\\\", \\\\\"Basic Instinct\\\\\" and \\\\\"Starship Troopers\\\\\" is about a psychopathic and disillusioned author (Jeroen Krabbe) going to the seaside for recovering. There he meets a mysterious femme fatale (Renee Soultendieck) and starts a fatal love affair with her.

Sunny becomes a national heroine and media celebrity and as a reward is offered a job working for the Protocol Section of the United States Department of State. Unknown to her however, the State Department officials who offer her the job have a hidden agenda.<br /><br />A map we see shows Ohtar lying on the borders of Saudi Arabia and South Yemen, in an area of barren desert known as the Rub al-Khali, or Empty Quarter. In real life a state in this location would have a population of virtually zero, and virtually zero strategic value, but for the purposes of the film we have to accept that Ohtar is of immense strategic importance in the Cold War and that the American government, who are keen to build a military base there, need to do all that they can in order to keep on the good side of its ruler. It transpires that the Emir has taken a fancy to the attractive young woman who saved him and he has reached a deal with the State Department; they can have their base provided that he can have Sunny as the latest addition to his harem. Sunny\\'s new job is just a ruse to ensure that the Emir has further opportunities to meet her.<br /><br />A plot like this could have been the occasion for some hilarious satire, but in fact the film\\'s satirical content is rather toned down. Possibly in 1984 the American public were not in the mood for trenchant satire on their country\\'s foreign policy; this was, after all, the year in which Ronald Reagan carried forty-nine out of fifty states in the Presidential election and his hard line with the Soviet Union was clearly going down well with the voters. (If the film had been made a couple of years later, in the wake of the Iran/Contra affair, its tone might have been different).<br /><br />The film is not so much a satire as a vehicle for Goldie Hawn to show off her brand of cuteness and charm. Sunny is a typical Goldie character- pretty, sweet-natured, naive and not too bright. There is, however, a limit to how far you can go with cuteness and charm alone, and you cannot automatically make a bad film a good one just by making the leading character a dumb blonde. (Actually, that sounds more like a recipe for making a good film a bad one). Goldie tries her best to save this one, but never succeeds. Part of the reason is the inconsistent way in which her character is portrayed. On the one hand Sunny is a sweet, innocent country girl from Oregon. On the other hand she is a 35-year-old woman who works in a sleazy bar and wears a revealing costume. The effect is rather like imagining Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm grown up and working as a Bunny Girl.<br /><br />The more important reason why Goldie is unable to rescue this film is even the best comedian or comedienne is no better than his/her material, and \\\\\"Protocol\\\\\" is simply unfunny. Whatever humour exists is tired and strained, relying on offensive stereotypes about Arab men who, apparently, all lust after Western women, particularly if they are blonde and blue-eyed. There was a lot of this sort of thing about in the mid-eighties, as this was the period which also saw the awful Ben Kingsley/ Nastassia Kinski film \\\\\"Harem\\\\\", about a lascivious Middle Eastern ruler who kidnaps a young American woman, and the mini-series of the same name which told a virtually identical story with a period setting. The film-makers seem to have realised that their film would not work as a pure comedy, because towards the end it turns into a sort of latter-day \\\\\"Mr Smith Goes to Washington\\\\\". Sunny turns from a blonde bimbo into a fount of political wisdom and starts uttering all sorts of platitudes about Democracy and the Constitution and the Citizen\\'s Duty to Vote and We The People and how the Price of Liberty is Eternal Vigilance blah blah blah\\x85\\x85, but in truth the film is no more successful as a political parable than it is as a comedy.<br /><br />Goldie Hawn has made a number of good comedies, such as \\\\\"Cactus Flower\\\\\", \\\\\"Overboard\\\\\" and \\\\\"\\\\\"Housesitter\\\\\", but \\\\\"Protocol\\\\\" is not one of them.

The documentaries are varied and deal with all sorts of concepts, the only thing being shared is 9/11 as a theme (very minor in some cases). Some of the segements are weak while others are very strong; some are political, some are not; some are solely about 9/11, some simply use 9/11 as a theme to touch on human feelings, emotions and tragedies that are universal; some are mainstream while others are abstract and artistic). This film has not been censored in any fashion by anyone so the thoughts that you see are very raw and powerful.<br /><br />This is a very controversial film, especially for conservative Americans. I think two segments might really tick off the right wingers (one from Egypt where a dead American soldier and a dead Palestinian bomber come back as spirits; another from UK which recounts the US-backed overthrow of Chile on Sept 11, 1973, which resulted in 50,000 deaths and horrible atrocities). The segment from Mexico was the most powerful, recounting the fall of the towers and the resulting death in vivid fashion (you have to see it to believe it).<br /><br />Even though the final product is uneven, with some segments being almost \\\\\"pointless\\\\\", I still recommend this. It\\'s very difficult to rank this film because the segments vary all over the place (some weak, some very powerful; ).

       "  '\"I love MIDNIGHT COWBOY and have it in my video collection as it is a favorite of mine. What is interesting to me is how when MIDNIGHT COWBOY came out in 1969, it was so shocking to viewers that it was rated X. Of course, at that time X meant Maturity. Since I was only two years old at the time of the movie\\'s release, it is hard for me to imagine just how shocked viewers were back then. However, when I try to take into account that many of the topics covered in the film, which included prostitution (the title itself was slang for a male prostitute); homosexuality; loneliness; physical (and to some extent emotional as well) abuse and drugs are hard for many people to talk about to this day, I can begin to get a sense of what viewers of this movie thought back on its release. It is worth noting that in the 1970\\'s, MIDNIGHT COWBOY was downgraded to an R rating and even though it is still rated R, some of the scenes could almost be rated PG-13 by today\\'s standards.<br /><br />I want to briefly give a synopsis of the plot although it is probably known to almost anyone who has heard of the movie. Jon Voight plays a young man named Joe Buck from Texas who decides that he can make it big as a male hustler in New York City escorting rich women. He emulates cowboy actors like Roy Rogers by wearing a cowboy outfit thinking that that will impress women. After being rejected by all the women he has come across, he meets a sleazy con-man named Enrico \\\\\"Ratso\\\\\" Rizzo who is played by Dustin Hoffman. Ratso convinces Joe that he can make all kinds of money if he has a manager. Once again, Joe is conned and before long is homeless. However, Joe comes across Ratso and is invited to stay in a dilapidated apartment. Without giving away much more of the plot, I want to say that the remainder of the movie deals with Joe and Ratso as they try to help one another in an attempt to fulfill their dreams. I.E. Joe making it as a gigolo and Ratso going down to Florida where he thinks he can regain his health.<br /><br />I want to make some comments about the movie itself. First of all, the acting is excellent, especially the leads. Although the movie is really very sad from the beginning to the end, there are some classic scenes. In fact, there are some scenes that while they are not intended to be funny, I find them amusing. For example, there is the classic scene where Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight are walking down a city street and a cab practically runs them over. Dustin Hoffman bangs on the cab and says \\\\\"Hey, I\\'m walkin\\' here! I\\'m walkin\\' here!\\\\\" I get a kick out of that scene because it is so typical of New York City where so many people are in a hurry. Another scene that comes to mind is the scene where Ratso (Dustin Hoffman) sends Joe (Jon Voight) to a guy named O\\'Daniel. What is amusing is that at first, we think O\\'Daniel is there to recruit gigolos and can see why Joe is getting so excited but then we begin to realize that O\\'Daniel is nothing but a religious nut. In addition to the two scenes I mentioned, I love the scene where Ratso and Joe are arguing in their apartment when Ratso says to Joe that his cowboy outfit only attracts homosexuals and Joe says in self-defense \\\\\"John Wayne! You gonna tell me he\\'s a fag!\\\\\" What I like is the delivery in that scene.<br /><br />I would say that even though MIDNIGHT COWBOY was set in the late \\'60\\'s, much of it rings true today. That\\'s because although the area around 42nd Street in New York has been cleaned up in the form of Disneyfication in the last several years, homelessness is still just as prevalent there now as it was 40 years ago. Also, many people have unrealistic dreams of how they are going to strike it big only to have their dreams smashed as was the case with the Jon Voight character. One thing that impresses me about Jon Voight\\'s character is how he is a survivor and I felt that at the end of the movie, he had matured a great deal and that Ratso (Dustin Hoffman\\'s character) was a good influence on him.<br /><br />In conclusion, I want to say that I suggest that when watching this movie, one should watch it at least a couple of times because there are so many things that go on. For example, there are a bunch of flashback and dream sequences that made more sense to me after a couple of viewings. Also, what I find interesting is that there is a lot in this movie that is left to interpretation such as what really happened with Joe Buck (Jon Voight\\'s character) and the people who were in his life in Texas. Even the ending, while I don\\'t want to give it away for those who have not seen the movie, is rather open-ended.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"I am uncertain what to make of this misshapen 2007 dramedy. Attempting to be a new millennium cross-hybrid between On Golden Pond and The Prince of Tides, this film ends up being an erratic mess shifting so mercurially between comedy and melodrama that the emotional pitch always seems off. The main problem seems to be the irreconcilable difference between Garry Marshall\\'s sentimental direction and Mark Andrus\\' dark, rather confusing screenplay. The story focuses on the unraveling relationship between mother Lilly and daughter Rachel, who have driven all the way from San Francisco to small-town Hull, Idaho where grandmother Georgia lives. The idea is for Lilly to leave Rachel for the summer under Georgia\\'s taskmaster jurisdiction replete with her draconian rules since the young 17-year old has become an incorrigible hellion.<br /><br />The set-up is clear enough, but the characters are made to shift quickly and often inexplicably between sympathetic and shrill to fit the contrived contours of the storyline. It veers haphazardly through issues of alcoholism, child molestation and dysfunctional families until it settles into its pat resolution. The three actresses at the center redeem some of the dramatic convolutions but to varying degrees. Probably due to her off-screen reputation and her scratchy smoker\\'s voice, Lindsay Lohan makes Rachel\\'s promiscuity and manipulative tactics palpable, although she becomes less credible as her character reveals the psychological wounds that give a reason for her hedonistic behavior. Felicity Huffman is forced to play Lilly on two strident notes - as a petulant, resentful daughter to a mother who never got close to her and as an angry, alcoholic mother who starts to recognize her own accountability in her daughter\\'s state of mind. She does what she can with the role on both fronts, but her efforts never add up to a flesh-and-blood human being.<br /><br />At close to seventy, Jane Fonda looks great, even as weather-beaten as she is here, and has the star presence to get away with the cartoon-like dimensions of the flinty Georgia. The problem I have with Fonda\\'s casting is that the legendary actress deserves far more than a series of one-liners and maternal stares. Between this and 2005\\'s execrable Monster-in-Law, it does make one wonder if her best work is behind her. It should come as no surprise that the actresses\\' male counterparts are completely overshadowed. Garrett Hedlund looks a little too surfer-dude as the naïve Harlan, a devout Mormon whose sudden love for Rachel could delay his two-year missionary stint. Cary Elwes plays on a familiar suspicious note as Lilly\\'s husband, an unfortunate case where predictable casting appears to telegraph the movie\\'s ending.<br /><br />There is also the omnipresent Dermot Mulroney in the morose triple-play role of the wounded widower, Lilly\\'s former flame and Rachel\\'s new boss as town veterinarian Dr. Simon Ward. Laurie Metcalf has a barely-there role as Simon\\'s sister Paula, while Marshall regular Hector Elizondo and songsmith Paul Williams show up in cameos. Some of Andrus\\' dialogue is plain awful and the wavering seriocomic tone never settles on anything that feels right. There are several small extras with the 2007 DVD, none all too exciting. Marshall provides a commentary track that has plenty of his trademark laconic humor. There are several deleted scenes, including three variations on the ending, and a gag reel. A seven-minute making-of featurette is included, as well as the original theatrical trailer, a six-minute short spotlighting the three actresses and a five-minute tribute to Marshall.\"'],\n",

When I watch this film a lot of it reminded me of 42nd Street, especially the character Eloise who\\'s a temperamental star and she ends up falling and breaks her ankle, like Bebe Daniels did in 42nd Street and another performer gets the part and become a star. This film, like most race films, keeps people watching because of the great entertainment. Race films always showed Black Entertainment as it truly was that was popular in that time era. The Dancing Styles, The Music, Dressing Styles, You\\'ll Love It. This movie could of been big if it was made in Hollywood, it would of had better scenery, better filming, and more money which would make any movie better. But its worth watching because it is good and Micheaux does good with the little he has. I have to say out of all Micheaux\\'s films, Swing is the best! The movie features singers, dancers, actresses, and actors who were popular but forgotten today. Doli Armena, a awesome female trumpet player who can blow the horn so good that you think Gabriel is blowing a horn in the sky. The sexy, hot female dancer Consuela Harris would put Ann Miller and Gyspy Rose Lee to shame.<br /><br />Adding further info... Popular blues singer of the 20\\'s and 30\\'s Cora Green is the focus of the film, she\\'s Mandy, a good, hard working woman with a no good man who takes her money and spend it on other women. A nosy neighbor played by Amanda Randolph tells Mandy what she seen and heard and Mandy goes down to the club and catches her man with an attractive, curvy woman by the name of Eloise (played Hazel Diaz, a Hot-Cha entertainer in the 30\\'s) and a fight breaks out. Then Mandy goes to Harlem where she reunites with a somewhat guardian angel Lena played by one of the most beautiful women in movies Dorothy Van Engle. Lena provides Mandy with a home, a job, and helps her become a star when temperamental Cora Smith (played by Hazel, I guess she\\'s playing two parts or maybe she changed her stage name) tries to ruin the show with her bad behavior. When Cora gets drunk and breaks her leg, Lena convinces everyone that Mandy is right for the job and Lena is right and a star is born in Mandy. Tall, long, lanky, but handsome Carman Newsome is the cool aspiring producer who Lena looks out for as well. Pretty boy Larry Seymour plays the no good man but after Lena threatens him, he might shape up. There are a few highlights but the one that sticks out to me is the part where Cora Smith (Hazel Diaz) struts in late for rehearsal and goes off on everyone and then her man comes in and punches her in the jaw but that\\'s not enough, she almost gets into a fight with Mandy again. In between there\\'s great entertainment by chorus girls, tap dancers, shake dancers, swing music, and blues singing. There\\'s even white people watching the entertainment, I wonder where Micheaux found them, there\\'s even a scene where there\\'s blacks and whites sitting together at the club, Micheaux frequently integrated blacks and whites in his films, he should be commended for such a bold move.<br /><br />This movie was the first race film I really enjoyed and it helped introduced me to Oscar Micheaux. This movie is one of the best of the race film genre, its a behind the scenes story about the ups and downs of show business.<br /><br />No these early race films may not be the best, can\\'t be compared with Hallelujah, Green Pastures, Stormy Weather, Cabin In The Sky, Carmen Jones, or any other Hollywood films but their great to watch because their early signs of black film-making and plus these films provide a glimpse into black life and black entertainment through a black person\\'s eyes. These films gave blacks a chance to play people from all walks of life, be beautiful, classy, and elegant, and not just be stereotypes or how whites felt blacks should be portrayed like in Hollywood. Most of the actors and actresses of these race films weren\\'t the best, but they were the only ones that could be afforded at the time, Micheaux and Spencer Williams couldn\\'t afford Nina Mae McKinney, Josephine Baker, Ethel Waters, Fredi Washington, Paul Robeson, Rex Ingram, and more of the bigger stars, so Micheaux and other black and white race film-makers would use nightclub performers in their movies, some were good, some weren\\'t great actors and actresses, but I think Micheaux and others knew most weren\\'t good actors and actresses but they were used more as apart of an experiment than for true talent, they just wanted their stories told, and in return many black performers got to perform their true talents in the films. For some true actors/actresses race films were the only type of films they could get work, especially if they didn\\'t want to play Hollywood stereotypes, so I think you\\'ll be able to spot the true actors/actresses from the nightclub performers. These race films are very historic, they could have been lost forever, many are lost, maybe race films aren\\'t the greatest example of cinema but even Hollywood films didn\\'t start out great in the beginning. I think if the race film genre continued, it would have better. If your looking for great acting, most race films aren\\'t the ones, but if your looking for a real example of black entertainment and how blacks should have been portrayed in films, than watch race films. There are some entertaining race films with a good acting cast, Moon Over Harlem, Body and Soul, Paradise In Harlem, Keep Punching, Sunday Sinners, Dark Manhattan, Broken Strings, Boy! What A Girl, Mystery In Swing, Miracle In Harlem, and Sepia Cinderella, that not only has good entertainment but good acting.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"This is the best Emma in existence in my opinion. Having seen the other version (1996) which is also good, and read the book, I think I can safely say with confidence that this is the true interpretation and is the most faithful to Jane Austen\\'s masterpiece. The 1996 movie with G. Paltrow is good too, it\\'s just that it\\'s almost like a different story altogether. It\\'s very light and fluffy, you don\\'t see the darker edges of the characters and if you just want a pleasant movie, that one would do fine but the intricacies of some of the plot points, such as the Churchill/Fairfax entanglement is so much glossed over as to be virtually non-existent. But if you want the characters fleshed out a bit, more real and multidimensional, the 1996 TV version is the superior. Emma is a remarkable person, but she is flawed. Kate Beckinsale is masterful at showing the little quirks of the character. You see her look casually disgusted at some of the more simple conversation of Harriet Smith, yet she shows no remorse for having ruined Harriet\\'s proposal until that action has the effect of ruining her own marital happiness at the ending. You see her narcissism and it mirrors Frank Churchill\\'s in that they would do harm to others to achieve their own aims. For Emma, it was playing matchmaker and having a new friend to while away the time with after having suffered the loss of her governess to marriage. For Frank Churchill, it is securing the promise of the woman he loves while treating her and others abominably to keep the secret. In the book, she realizes all of this in a crushing awakening to all the blunders she has made. Both Kate Beckinsale and Gyneth Paltrow are convincing in their remorse but Paltrow\\'s is more childlike and stagnant while Beckinsale\\'s awakening is rather real and serious and you see the transition from child-like, selfish behavior to kind and thoughtful adult. Both versions are very good but I prefer this one.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"Every motion picture Bette Davis stars in is worth experiencing. Before Davis co-stars with Leslie Howard in \\\\\"Of Human Bondage,\\\\\" she\\'d been in over a score of movies. Legend has it that Davis was \\'robbed\\' of a 1935 Oscar for her performance as a cockney-speaking waitress, unwed mother & manipulative boyfriend-user, Mildred Rogers. The story goes that the AFI consoled Davis by awarding her 1st Oscar for playing Joyce Heath in \\\\\"Dangerous.\\\\\" I imagine Davis\\' fans of \\\\\"Of Human Bondage\\\\\" who agree with the Oscar-robbing legend are going to have at my critique\\'s contrast of the 1934 film for which the AFI didn\\'t award her performance & the 1936 film \\\\\"Dangerous,\\\\\" performance for which she received her 1st Oscar in 1937.<br /><br />I\\'ve tried to view all of Bette Davis\\' motion pictures, TV interviews, videos, advertisements for WWII & TV performances in popular series. In hindsight, it is easy to recognize why this film, \\\\\"Of Human Bondage,\\\\\" gave Davis the opportunity to be nominated for her performance. She was only 25yo when the film was completed & just about to reach Hollywood\\'s red carpet. The public began to notice Bette Davis as a star because of her performance in \\\\\"Of Human Bondage.\\\\\" That is what makes it her legendary performance. But, RKO saw her greatness in \\\\\"The Man Who Played God,\\\\\" & borrowed her from Warners to play Rogers.<br /><br />I\\'m going to go with the AFI, in hindsight, some 41 years after their astute decision to award Davis her 1st Best Actress Oscar for \\\\\"Dangerous,\\\\\" 2 years later. By doing so, the AFI may have been instrumental in bringing out the very best in one of Hollywood\\'s most talented 20th century actors. Because, from \\\\\"Of Human Bondage,\\\\\" onward, Davis knew for certain that she had to reach deep inside of herself to find the performances that earned her the golden statue. Doubtless, she deserved more than 2 Oscars; perhaps as many as 6.<br /><br />\\\\\"Dangerous\\\\\" provides an exemplary contrast in Davis\\' depth of acting characterization. For, it\\'s in \\\\\"Dangerous\\\\\" (1936) that she becomes the greatest actor of the 20th century. Davis is so good as Joyce Heath, she\\'s dead-center on the red carpet. Whereas in \\\\\"Of Human Bondage,\\\\\" Davis is right off the edge, still on the sidewalk & ready to take off on the rest of her 60 year acting career.<br /><br />Perhaps by not awarding her that legendary Oscar in 1935, instead of a star being born, an actor was given incentive to reach beyond stardom into her soul for the gifted actor\\'s greatest work.<br /><br />It is well known that her contemporary peer adversary was Joan Crawford; a star whose performances still don\\'t measure up to Davis\\'. Even Anna Nicole Smith was a \\'star\\'. Howard Stern is a radio host \\'star\\', too. Lots of people on stage & the silver screen are stars. Few became great actors. The key difference between them is something that Bette Davis could sense: the difference between the desire to do great acting or to become star-struck.<br /><br />Try comparing these two movies as I have, viewing one right after the other. Maybe you\\'ll recognize what the AFI & I did. Davis was on the verge of becoming one of the greatest actors of the 20th century at 25yo & achieved her goal by the time she was 27. She spent her next 50 plus years setting the bar so high that it has not been reached . . . yet.<br /><br />Had the AFI sent her the message that she\\'d arrived in \\\\\"Of Human Bondage,\\\\\" Davis\\' life history as a great actor may have been led into star-struck-dom, instead.\"'],\n",

It\\'s actually not long enough, in a way. All of the major bases in the decades are covered, and they\\'re all interesting to note as views into post-modern history and from different sides. But it almost doesn\\'t cover enough, or at least what is covered at times is given a once over when it could deserve more time. For example, the information and detail in part three about the whole process and business unto itself of shipping mass amounts of drugs (partly the marijuana, later cocaine) is really well presented, but there are more details that are kept at behest of how much time there is to cover.<br /><br />Overall though the documentary does shed enough light on how drugs, pop-culture, government intervention, the upper classes and lower classes and into suburbia, all felt the wave of various drugs over the years, and the interplay between all was very evident. Nobody in the film- except for the possibility of small hints with the pot)- goes to endorse drugs outright, but what is shown are those in archival clips about the honesty of what is at times fun, and then tragic, about taking certain drugs. The appearances of various staunch, ridiculously anti-drug officials does hammer some points down hard- with even in such an overview of the drug cultures and America\\'s connection as a whole- as there is really only one major point that is made a couple of times by one of the interviewees. The only way to really approach the issue of drugs is not \\'just say no\\', because as the war on drugs has shown it is not as effective as thought. It is really just to come clean on all sides about all the drugs and the people who may be hypocritical about them (as, for example, oxycontin continues on in the marketplace).<br /><br />Is it with the great interest and depth of a Ken Burns documentary? No, but for some summertime TV viewing for the young (i.e. my age) who will view a lot of this as almost ancient history despite most of it being no more than a generation ago, as well as for the \\'old\\' who can reflect some decades later about the great peaks, careless times, and then the disillusionment prodded more by the same media that years earlier propagated and advertised it. There are those who might find the documentary to be particularly biased, which is not totally untrue, but it does attempt to get enough different takes on the social, political, and entertainment conditions of drugs interweaving (for better or obvious worse) for enough of a fascinating view.\"'],\n",

Most of the movie could play the same way even if Rodney\\'s character had only one wife, so the premise seems more like an old man\\'s fantasy than a key part of the comedy. Another old man\\'s fantasy: we\\'re supposed to accept that Rodney\\'s character is an athletic skier.<br /><br />Jerry Stiller seems to be phoning in his role just to do a buddy a favor, and the rest of the name actors must simply be desperate for work.<br /><br />The odd nods to political correctness later in the movie don\\'t really do anything for the movie. For those who like their movies politically correct, the non-PC humor is still there in the first place, and the seeming apologies for it still don\\'t get the point. For those who hate seeing a movie cave in to political correctness, the PC add-ins are just annoying digressions.<br /><br />This has to be the mildest R-rated movie I\\'ve ever seen. There are some racy jokes, and the bedroom scenes would have made shocking TV 40 years ago, but that\\'s about it. Maybe it was the topless men (kidding).<br /><br />The DVD features interviews where the cast members seem to find depth and importance in this movie and in their roles. I kept wondering if they were serious or kidding. They seem to be serious, but I kept thinking, \\\\\"They must be kidding!\\\\\" There\\'s also a peculiar disclaimer suggesting that since the movie never actually names the Mormons or the Church of Latter-Day Saints, that somehow it\\'s not about them. Never mind that the movie features a polygamous religion in Utah, and makes reference to Brigham Young.<br /><br />In short, My 5 Wives was a disappointment. I was hoping for Rodney on a roll, but the best I can say for the movie is that Rodney was looking pretty good for a guy who was pushing 80 at the time.\"'],\n",

For not only has Rohmer attempted (with success) to make us see the world through the genre art of 18th century France but, as ali has pointed out, has shown (at the cost of alienating his audience) the effects of both class consciousness and the revolution it inspired through the eyes of a dislikably elitist woman of her times. The director has accomplished something undeniably difficult, but I question whether it was worth the effort it took for him to do so -- or for us to watch the dull results of his labor.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"If there was anything Akira Kurosawa did wrong in making Dodes\\'ka-den, it was making it with the partnership he formed with the \\\\\"four knights\\\\\" (the other three being Kobayaski, Ichikawa, and Konishita). They wanted a big blockbuster hit to kick off their partnership, and instead Kurosawa, arguably the head cheese of the group, delivered an abstract, humanist art film with characters living in a decimated slum that had many of its characters face dark tragedies. Had he made it on a more independent basis or went to another studio who knows, but it was because of this, among some other financial and creative woes, that also contributed to his suicide attempt in 1971. And yet, at the end of the day, as an artist Kurosawa didn\\'t stop delivering what he\\'s infamous for with his dramas: the strengths of the human spirit in the face of adversity. That its backdrop is a little more unusual than most shouldn\\'t be ignored, but it\\'s not at all a fault of Kurosawa\\'s.<br /><br />The material in Dodes\\'ka-den is absorbing, but not in ways that one usually finds from the director, and mostly because it is driven by character instead of plot. There\\'s things that happen to these people, and Kurosawa\\'s challenge here is to interweave them into a cohesive whole. The character who starts off in the picture, oddly enough (though thankfully as there\\'s not much room for him to grow), is Rokkuchan, a brain damaged man-child who goes around all day making train sounds (the \\'clickety-clack\\' of the title), only sometimes stopping to pray for his mother. But then we branch off: there\\'s the father and son, the latter who scrounges restaurants for food and the former who goes on and on with site-specific descriptions of his dream house; an older man has the look of death to him, and we learn later on he\\'s lost a lot more than he\\'ll tell most people, including a woman who has a past with him; a shy, quiet woman who works in servitude to her adoptive father (or uncle, I\\'m not sure), who rapes her; and a meek guy in a suit who has a constant facial tick and a big mean wife- to those who are social around.<br /><br />There are also little markers of people around these characters, like two drunks who keep stumbling around every night, like clockwork, putting big demands on their spouses, sometimes (unintentionally) swapping them! And there\\'s the kind sake salesman on the bike who has a sweet but strange connection with the shy quiet woman. And of course there\\'s a group of gossiping ladies who squat around a watering hole in the middle of the slum, not having anything too nice to say about anyone unless it\\'s about something erotic with a guy. First to note with all of this is how Kurosawa sets the picture; it\\'s a little post-apocalyptic, looking not of any particular time or place (that is until in a couple of shots we see modern cars and streets). It\\'s a marginalized society, but the concerns of these people are, however in tragic scope, meant to be deconstructed through dramatic force. Like Bergman, Kurosawa is out to dissect the shattered emotions of people, with one scene in particular when the deathly-looking man who has hollow, sorrowful eyes, sits ripping cloth in silence as a woman goes along with it.<br /><br />Sometimes there\\'s charm, and even some laughs, to be had with these people. I even enjoyed, maybe ironically, the little moments with Rokkuchan (specifically with Kurosawa\\'s cameo as a painter in the street), or the awkward silences with the man with the facial tics. But while Kurosawa allows his actors some room to improvise, his camera movements still remain as they\\'ve always been- patient but alert, with wide compositions and claustrophobic shots, painterly visions and faces sometimes with the stylization of a silent drama meant as a weeper. Amid these sometimes bizarre and touching stories, with some of them (i.e. the father and son in the car) especially sad, Kurosawa lights his film and designs the color scheme as his first one in Eastmancolor like it\\'s one of his paintings. Lush, sprawling, spilling at times over the seams but always with some control, this place is not necessarily \\\\\"lighter\\\\\"; it\\'s like the abstract has come full-throttle into the scene, where things look vibrant but are much darker underneath. It\\'s a brilliant, tricky double-edged sword that allows for the dream-like intonations with such heavy duty drama.<br /><br />With a sweet \\'movie\\' score Toru Takemitsu (also responsible for Ran), and some excellent performances from the actors, and a few indelible scenes in a whole fantastic career, Dodes\\'ka-den is in its own way a minor work from the director, but nonetheless near perfect on its own terms, which as with many Kurosawa dramas like Ikiru and Red Beard holds hard truths on the human condition without too much sentimentality.\"'],\n",

As soon as a few critics say something new is good (ie - \\\\\"Shake-Cam\\\\\"), everyone jumps on the bandwagon, as if they are devoid of independent thought. This was not a good movie, it was a dreadful movie. 1) Plot? - What plot? Bourne was chased from here to there, from beginning to end. That\\'s the plot. Don\\'t look for anything deeper than this. 2) Cinematography? - Do me a favor! Any 7 year old armed with an old and battered 8mm movie camera would do a far better job (I am not exaggerating here). This film is a tour-de-force of astonishingly amateurish camera-work. The ridiculous shaking of EVERY (I really do mean every) scene will cause dizziness and nausea. 3) Believable? - Oh yes definitely. This is a masterpiece of credibility. I loved scenes about Bourne being chased by (local) police through the winding market streets of Tangier. - I\\'ve BEEN to Tangier. Even the guides can\\'t navigate their way through those streets but Bourne shook off 100 police with speed and finesse. Greengrass must be laughing his head off at the gullibility of his film disciples. 4) Editing? - I don\\'t know what the editor was on when he did this film but I want some! - Every scene is between 0.5 and 2 seconds. I felt nauseous at the end of the film from the strobe effect of the \\\\\"scenes\\\\\" flashing by. 5) Directing? - Hmmm. This is an interesting aspect. The film appears to have actually NOT had any directing. More a case of Greengrass throwing a copy of the script (all two pages) at the cameramen and told to \\\\\"shoot a few scenes whilst drunk\\\\\". - \\\\\"Don\\'t worry boys, we\\'ll tie the scenes together in the editing room\\\\\". The editor should be tarred, feathered and put in the stocks for allowing this monstrosity to hit the silver screen 6) Not one but TWO senior CIA operatives giving the tender feminine treatment to the mistreated and misunderstood Jason Bourne. - Putting their lives on the line for someone they couldn\\'t even be sure wasn\\'t a traitor. Talk about stupid nincompoops. (Whilst the evil male CIA members plot to terminate any operative who so much as drops a paper-clip on the floor). (well, all men are evil, aren\\'t they? - Except for SNAGS of course). Yes, this really is a modern and politically correct film that shows the females to be the heroes of the day and the oppressive males as the real threat to humanity. 7) When the you-know-what finally hits the fan, good triumphs over evil (just like it always does, eh?) and the would-be assassin gets the drop on Jason Bourne - he suddenly undergoes a guilt trip and refrains from pulling the trigger (Yeah - right...) - at that very moment, the evil deputy director just happens to turn up - gun in hand and he does pull the trigger. - How did this 60 year old man run so fast and not even be out of breath? Wonders will never cease 8) Don\\'t worry, there\\'s a senate hearing and the baddies get pulled up before the courts.

The show gets it rolling from the very first episode, a retired Jack O\\'Neill has to go through the gate once more to meet with his old companion, Dr. Daniel Jackson. Through the first two episodes, we meet Samantha Carter, a very intelligent individual who lets no one walk over her, and there is Teal\\'c, a quiet, compassionate warrior who defies his false god and joins the team. <br /><br />The main bad guys are called the Gouald, they are parasites who can get inserted into one\\'s brain, thus controlling them and doing evil deeds. Any Gouald who has a massive amount of power is often deemed as a \\\\\"System Lord.\\\\\" The warriors behind the Gouald are called Jaffa, who house the parasitic Gouald in their bodies until the Gouald can get inserted in a person\\'s brain.<br /><br />Through the episodes, we mostly get to see SG-1, the exploratory team comprised of Jack/Daniel/Teal\\'c/and Sam, go through the wormhole that instantly transports them to other planets (this device is called the Stargate) and they encounter new cultures or bad guys. Some episodes are on-world, meaning that they do not go through the Stargate once in the episode and rather deal with pressing issues on Earth.<br /><br />Through the years, you start to see a decline in the SG-1 team as close knit, and more character-building story lines. This, in turn means even more on-world episodes, which is perfectly understandable.<br /><br />My rating: 8.75/10----While most of this show is good, there are some instances of story lines not always getting wrapped up and less of an emphasis on gate travel these last few years.

The shared ordeal for the characters and audience is really dissimilar from the fright and tension of horror movies since there\\'s no tangible supernatural element here.

Finlay tries to make Cena look good. The finish was botched. Finlay hit Batista\\'s knee with a chair shot and Batista no-sold the shot and finished the match. Lame. Not main event caliber at all.<br /><br />Overall, Armageddon would have scored less, but the ladder match WAS the main event here. That was enough money\\'s worth right there. A few others were solid. <br /><br />The Last Word: A good PPV with the ladder match being the savior. Smackdown is not a bad show just is not compelling enough.

WRONG. This conversation provides no coherent narrative whatsoever. Rather on the contrary, Domino\\'s lesbian come on on Lucy Liu\\'s character during the second part of the movie just throws the audience into further confusion.<br /><br />Then i thought that maybe it is a movie about a girl from affluent but dysfunctional background who grew to be a tough bounty hunter. In any case, that is the message conveyed by the opening scenes. But after that the question of Domino\\'s character is entirely lost to the criminal plot. So in short, NO this is NOT a movie about Domino\\'s character.<br /><br />Then i thought, it\\'s probably a story of one robbery. A pretty bloody robbery. 10 millions went missing, bounty hunters are chasing around suspected robbers, mafia kids are executed, hands are removed, Domino tries to crack why this time they get no bounty certificates, etc. But soon this impression is dispelled by another U-turn of the plot.<br /><br />This time we are confronted with a sad story of an obese Afro-American woman, who fakes driver\\'s licenses at the local MVD and at the age of 28 happens to be a youngest grandmother. Lateesha stars on Jerry Springer show, tries to publicize some new, wacky racial theory, and at the same time struggles to find money for her sick granddaughter.<br /><br />What does this have to do with the main plot? URgh, well, nobody knows. Except that director had to explain the audiences where will bounty hunters put their collectors\\' fee of 300,000.<br /><br />Then at some point you start to think: \\\\\"Oh, it is about our society and the way media distorts things\\\\\". There is reality TV crew driving around with the bounty hunters and doing some violent footage. The bounty hunters are also stuck with a bunch of Hollywood actors, who just whine all the time about having their noses broken and themselves dragged around too many crime scenes. But NO, this is not a movie about media, they just appear sporadically throughout the movie.<br /><br />Plus there are numerous other sub-plots: the crazy Afghani guy bent on liberating Afghanistan, the love story between Domino and Chocco, the mescaline episode, the FBI surveillance operation...<br /><br />Can all of the things mentioned above be packed into 2 hrs movie?

She was magnificent, being both tough-as-nails, and drop-dead gorgeous. Like in her other films, Pam outshines the other characters, in Coffy.

I am very much a sci-fi aficionado and enjoy action type films. I happened to be up all night and was about ready to call it a day when I noticed this film playing in the morning. This is not a sci-fi nor action film of any sort. Let me just start out by saying that I am not a fan of Witchblade nor of Eric Etebari, having watched a few episodes(his performance in that seemed stale and robotic). But he managed to really win me over in this performance. I mean really win me over. Having seen Cellular, I did not think there was much in the way of acting for this guy. But his performance as Kasadya was simply amazing. He was exceedingly convincing as the evil demon. But there was so much in depth detail to this character it absolutely amazed me. I later looked it up online and found that Eric won the Best Actor award which is well deserved considering its the best of his career and gained my respect. Now I keep reading about the fx of this and production of this project and let me just say that I did not pay attention to them (sorry Brian). They were very nicely done but I was even more impressed with the story - which I think was even more his goal(Seeing films like Godzilla with huge effects just really turned me off). I could not sleep after this film thinking it over and over again in my head. The situation of an abusive family is never an easy one.

I know that the Mexican people have some odd ideas about religion, mixing up ancient Aztec beliefs with traditional Christian theology. But their Day of the Dead isn\\'t half as scary as their take on Santa Claus.<br /><br />So..Santa isn\\'t some jolly, fat red-suited alcoholic(take a look at those rosy cheeks sometime!).

This Santa is a Peeping Tom pervert who watches and listens to everything that everybody does from his \\'eye in the sky\\'. This is so he can tell who\\'s been naughty or nice(with an emphasis on those who are naughty, I\\'d bet).<br /><br />There\\'s no Mrs. Claus, no elves(what does he need elves for when he\\'s got child labor?) and the reindeer are mechanical wind-up toys! This floating freak show hovers on a cloud, presumably held up by its silver lining.<br /><br />Santa\\'s nemesis is...the Devil?! What is this, Santa our Lord and Savior? Weird. Anyhoo, Satan sends one of his minions, a mincing, prancing devil named Pitch, to try to screw up Christmas. Let me get this straight-the forces of purest evil are trying to ruin a completely commercial and greed driven holiday? Seems kind of redundant, doesn\\'t it?<br /><br />Pitch is totally ineffectual. He tries to talk some children into being bad, but doesn\\'t have much luck. I was strongly struck by the storyline of the saintly little girl Lupe, who\\'s family is very poor. All that she wants is a doll for Christmas, but he parents can\\'t afford to buy her one(they spent all of their money on the cardboard that they built their house out of). So Pitch tries to encourage her to steal a doll. In reality, that\\'s the only way that a girl that poor would ever get a doll, because being saintly and praying to God and holy Santa doesn\\'t really work. But Lupe resists temptation and tells Pitch to get thee behind her, and so is rewarded by being given a doll so creepy looking that you just know that it\\'s Chucky\\'s sister.<br /><br />Along the way Pitch manages to get Santa stuck in a tree(uh-huh) from whence he\\'s rescued by Merlin! Merlin? You have got to be kidding me! Since when do mythical Druidic figures appear in Christmas tales, or have anything to do with a Christian religion? And doesn\\'t God disapprove of magic? They\\'d have been burning Merlin at the stake a few hundred years ago, not asking him to come to the rescue of one of God\\'s Aspects(or that\\'s what I assume Santa must be, to be going up against Satan).

An adaptation of Gore Vidal\\'s best-selling book (he later disowned this film version), the star-studded MYRA BRECKINRIDGE is truly a movie so bad that it remains bizarrely entertaining from beginning to end. The X-rated movie about sex change operations and Hollywood was an absolute catastrophe at the box office and was literally booed off the screen by both critics and audiences at the time of it\\'s release. Not surprisingly, the film went on to gain a near-legendary cult status among lovers of bad cinema, and I was actually quite excited to finally see for the first time.<br /><br />Director Michael Sarne (who only had two other previous directing credits to his name at the time), took a lot of flack for the finished film, and, in honesty, it really does not look like he had a clue about what he was trying to achieve. The film is often incoherent, with entire sequences edited together in such a half-hazzard manner that many scenes become nearly incomprehensible. Also irritating is the gimmick of using archival footage from the Fox film vaults and splicing it into the picture at regular intervals. This means that there is archival footage of past film stars such as Judy Garland and Shirley Temple laced into newly-film scenes of often lewd sexual acts, and the process just doesn\\'t work as intended (this also caused a minor uproar, as actors such as Temple and Loretta Young sued the studio for using their image without permission).<br /><br />Perhaps Sarne is not the only one to blame, however, as the film\\'s screenplay and casting will also make many viewers shake their heads in disbelief. For instance, this film will ask you to believe that the scrawny film critic Rex Reed (in his first and last major film role) could have a sex change operation and emerge as the gorgeous sex goddess Raquel Welch?! The film becomes further hard to follow when Welch as Myra attempts to take over a film school from her sleazy uncle (played by legendary film director John Huston), seduce a nubile female film student (Farrah Fawcett), and teach the school\\'s resident bad boy (Roger Herren) a lesson by raping him with a strap-on dildo. Did everyone follow that? <br /><br />And it gets even better (or worse, depending upon your perspective)! I have yet to mention the film\\'s top-billed star: the legendary screen sex symbol of the nineteen-thirties, Mae West! Ms. West was 77 year old when she appeared in this film (she had been retired for 26 years), and apparently she still considered herself to be a formidable sex symbol as she plays an upscale talent agent who has hunky men (including a young Tom Selleck) throwing themselves at her. As if this weren\\'t bad enough, the tone-deaf West actually performs two newly-written songs about halfway through the film, and I think that I might have endured permanent brain damage from listening to them! <br /><br />Naturally, none of this even closely resembles anything that any person of reasonable taste would describe as \\\\\"good,\\\\\" but I would give MYRA BRECKINRIDGE a 4 out of 10 because it was always morbidly entertaining even when I had no idea what in the hell was supposed to be going on. Also, most of the cast tries really hard. Raquel, in particular, appears so hell-bent in turning her poorly-written part into something meaningful that she single-handedly succeeds in making the movie worth watching. If she had only been working with a decent screenplay and capable director then she might have finally received some respect form critics.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is also fine. The endearingly over-the-top John Huston (who really should have been directing the picture) has some funny moments, Rex Reed isn\\'t bad for a non-actor, and Farrah Fawcett is pleasantly fresh-faced and likable. Roger Herren is also fine, but he never appeared in another movie again after this (I guess he just couldn\\'t live down being the guy who was rapped by Raquel Welch). And as anyone could guess from the description above, Mae West was totally out of her mind when she agreed to do this movie - but that\\'s part of what makes it fun for those of us who love bad cinema.\"'],\n",

In the end, real snow of the Swiss Alps plays its part as well.<br /><br />Thus all three aspects of the title are addressed in this film. There is a lot of dope on scene, and there is also a pale, dark haired girl - with a prince who has to go through all kind of trouble to come to her rescue.<br /><br />But: It\\'s not a fairy tale. It\\'s supposed to be a realistic drama located in Zurich, Switzerland (according to the Tagline).<br /><br />Technically the movie is close to perfect. Unfortunately a weak plot, foreseeable dialogs, a mostly unreal scenery and the mixed acting don\\'t add up to create authenticity. Thus as a spectator I remained untouched.<br /><br />And then there were the clichés, which drove me crazy one by one: Snow White is a rich and spoiled upper class daughter - of course her parents are divorced and she never got enough love from them, because they were so busy all the time. Her best girlfriend, on the other hand, has loving and caring parents. They (a steelworker and a housewife) live in a tiny flat, poor and happy - and ignorant of the desperate situation their daughter is in. The good guy (= prince) is a musician (!) from the French speaking part of Switzerland (which is considered to be the economically less successful but emotionally fitter fraction of the country). He has problems with his parents. They are migrants from Spain, who don\\'t seem to accept his wild way of living - until the father becomes seriously ill and confesses his great admiration for his son from a hospital bed.<br /><br />And so it goes on: Naturally, the drug dealer is brutal, the bankers are heartless, the club owner is a playboy and the photographer, although a woman (!), has only her career in mind when she exposes Snow White in artsy pornographic pictures at a show.<br /><br />This review doesn\\'t need a spoiler in order to let you add these pieces to an obvious plot.

With only six months of the year gone, there are now two memorable, meaningful, worthwhile films in theaters, the other, of course, being Sara Polley\\'s \\\\\"Away from Her.\\\\\" Hollywood might have turned \\\\\"Evening\\\\\" into a slick celebrity vehicle with its two pairs of real-life mothers and daughters - Vanessa Redgrave and Natasha Richardson, and Meryl Streep and Mamie Gummer.

Instead, Koltai - the brilliant Hungarian cinematographer of \\\\\"Mephisto,\\\\\" and director of \\\\\"Fateless\\\\\" - created a subtle ensemble work with a \\\\\"Continental feel,\\\\\" the story taking place in a high-society Newport environment, in the days leading up to a wedding that is fraught with trouble.<br /><br />Missed connections, wrong choices, and dutiful compliance with social and family pressures present quite a soap opera, but the quality of the writing, Koltai\\'s direction, and selfless acting raise \\\\\"Evening\\\\\" way above that level, into the the rarified air of English, French (and a few American) family sagas from a century before its contemporary setting.<br /><br />Complex relationships between mothers and daughters, between friends and lovers, with the addition of a difficult triangle all come across clearly, understandably, captivatingly. Individual tunes are woven into a symphony.<br /><br />And yet, with the all the foregoing emphasis on ensemble and selfless performances, the stars of \\\\\"Evening\\\\\" still shine through, Redgrave, Richardson, Gummer (an exciting new discovery, looking vaguely like her mother, but a very different actress), Danes carrying most of the load - until Streep shows up in the final moments and, of course, steals the show. Dancy and Wilson are well worth the price of admission too.<br /><br />As with \\\\\"Away from Her,\\\\\" \\\\\"Evening\\\\\" stays with you at length, inviting a re-thinking its story and characters, and re-experiencing the emotions it raises.

Massacre falls right on its face as being one of the most boring slasher films I have seen come out of Italian cinema.

At one point in this film, someone (I believe Pacino\\'s producer) warns him that film is getting off track, that it was once about how the masses think about Shakespeare through the vehicle of RICHARD III. Instead he decides to shoot a chopped up play with random comments sprinkled throughout. Some scenes seemed to be included as home movies for Al (was there really ANY reason for the quick visit to Shakespeare\\'s birthplace, other than for a laugh about something unexpected which happens there?), and, before the film has really even begun, we are treated to seeing Al prance around and act cute and funny for the camera. I thought his silly act with Kay near the end of GODFATHER III with the knife to his throat was AN ACT - but apparently it\\'s how Al really behaves in person.<br /><br />Enough rambling. Here\\'s a shotgun smattering of why I didn\\'t even make it 3/4 of the way through this: 1) pretentious - Al always knows when the camera is on him, whether he\\'s acting as Richard or in a \\'real\\' conversation with someone - you can see it in the corner of his eyes, also, some of the actors around the rehearsal table become untethered and wax hammy to the extreme. If anyone reading this has ever spent any time with an group of actors and has witnessed this kind of thing from the outside, it\\'s unbearable. \\\\\"Look at me, chewing all the scenery!\\\\\" 2) Winona Ryder. When she appears as Lady Anne, this film comes to a screeching halt, which it never recovers from. She has nothing to add in the discussion scenes but the camera lingers on her to bring in the kiddoes. Her performance is dreadful, to boot. 3) the only things you really learn from this are told to you by the very scholars the filmmakers are trying to keep out of the picture. Of course, you also learn that Pacino shouldn\\'t be directing films (or doing Richard in the first place). I\\'d rather watch BOBBY DEERFIELD than this.<br /><br />Lastly, read the play and learn it for yourself. Go out and see it performed.

       "  '\"I\\'m always surprised about how many times you\\'ll see something about World War 2 on the German national television. You would think they don\\'t like to open old wounds, but there isn\\'t a week that goes by without a documentary or a movie about the horror and atrocities of this war. Perhaps it\\'s a way of dealing with their past, I don\\'t know, but you sure can\\'t blame them of ignoring what happened. And it has to be said: most of those documentaries are really worth a watch because they never try to gloss over the truth and the same can be said about their movies (think for instance about \\\\\"Der Untergang\\\\\" or \\\\\"The Downfall\\\\\" as you might now it) which are also very realistic.<br /><br />One of those movies is \\\\\"Rosenstrasse\\\\\". It tells a true story and deals with the subject of the mixed marriages during the war, even though the movie starts with a family in the USA, at the present day. After Hannah\\'s father died, her mother all a sudden turned into an orthodox Jew even though she hasn\\'t been very religious before. She doesn\\'t know where the strange behavior of her mother comes from, but as she starts digging in her mother\\'s troubled childhood, Hannah understands how little she has ever known about her mother\\'s past.<br /><br />The fact that this movie deals with the subject of the mixed marriages during the Nazi regime is already quite surprising. For as far as I know, there hasn\\'t been another movie that deals with this subject. (For those who didn\\'t know this yet: Being married to a so-called pure Aryian man or woman meant for many Jews that they weren\\'t immediately sent to one of the concentration camps, but that they had to work in a factory). But it does not only tell something about the problems of the mixed marriages, it also gives a good idea of how these people were often seen by their own parents and relatives. How difficult it sometimes was for them during the Nazi regime and how these people, most of the time women, did everything within their power to free their men, once they were captured and locked away in for instance the Rosenstrasse...<br /><br />The acting is really good and the story is very well written, although the way it was presented in the beginning didn\\'t really do it for me (and that\\'s exactly the only part that you\\'ll get to see in the trailer). Perhaps it\\'s just me, but I would have left out a big part of what happens in the present day. At least of the part that is situated in the USA, because the part where Hannah goes to Berlin and talks to someone who knows more about her mother\\'s past, definitely works.<br /><br />If you are interested in everything that has something to do with the Second World War, and if you aren\\'t necessarily looking for a lot of action shots, than this is definitely a movie you should see. This isn\\'t a movie in which you\\'ll see any battles or gunfights, but it certainly is an interesting movie, because it gives you an idea about an aspect of the war only little is known of. I give it an 8/10.\"'],\n",

They test the serum on an already invisible Gorilla & it works perfectly, Caine & his team of assistant\\'s celebrate but while he should report the breakthrough to his military backers Caine wants to be the first invisible human. He manages to persuade his team to help him & the procedure works well & Caine becomes invisible, however when they try to bring him back the serum fails & he remain invisible. The team desperately search for an antidote but nothing works, Caine slowly starts to lose his grip on reality as he realises what power he has but is unable to use it being trapped in a laboratory. But then again he\\'s invisible right, he can do anything he wants...<br /><br />Directed by Paul Verhoeven I rather liked Hollow Man. You know it\\'s just after Christmas, I saw this a few hours ago on late night/early morning cable TV & worst of all I feel sick, not because of the film but because of the chocolates & fizzy pop I\\'ve had over the past week so I\\'ll keep this one brief. The script by Andrew W. Marlowe has a decent pace about but it does drag a little during the middle & has a good central premise, it takes he basic idea that being invisible will make you insane just like in the original The Invisible Man (1933) film which Hollow Man obviously owes a fair bit. It manages to have a petty successful blend of horror, sci-fi & action & provide good entertainment value for 110 odd minutes. I thought the character\\'s were OK, I thought some of the ideas in the film were good although I think it\\'s generally known that Verhoeven doesn\\'t deal in subtlety, the first thing he has the invisible Caine do is sexually molest one of his team & then when he gets into the outside world he has Caine rape a woman with the justification \\'who\\'s going to know\\' that Caine says to himself. Then of course there\\'s the gore, he shows a rat being torn apart & that\\'s just the opening scene after the credits, to be fair to him the violence is a bit more sparse this time around but still has a quite nasty & sadistic tone about it. Having said that I love horror/gore/exploitation films so Hollow Man delivers for me, it\\'s just that it might not be everyone\\'s cup of tea.<br /><br />Director Verhoeven does a great job, or should that be the special effects boys make him look good. The special effects in Hollow Man really are spectacular & more-or-less flawless, their brilliant & it\\'s as simple & straight forward as that. There\\'s some good horror & action set-pieces here as well even if the climatic fight is a little over-the-top. I love the effect where Kevin Bacon disappears one layer at a time complete with veins, organs & bones on full show or when the reverse happens with the Gorilla. There\\'s a few gory moments including a rat being eaten, someone is impaled on a spike & someone has their head busted open with blood splattering results.<br /><br />With a staggering budget of about $95,000,000 Hollow Man is technically faultless, I can imagine the interviews on the DVD where some special effects boffin says they mapped Bacon\\'s entire body out right down to he last vein which they actually did because you know everyone watching would notice if one of his veins were missing or in the wrong position wouldn\\'t they? The acting was OK, Bacon made for a good mad scientist anti-hero type guy.<br /><br />Hollow Man is one of hose big budget Hollwood extravaganzas where the effects & action take center stage over any sort of meaningful story or character\\'s but to be brutally honest sometimes we all like that in a film, well I know I do. Good solid big budget entertainment with a slightly nastier & darker streak than the usual Hollywood product, definitely worth a watch.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"\\\\\"Panic In The Streets\\\\\" is an exciting and atmospheric thriller in which director Elia Kazan achieved a great sense of realism by shooting the movie in New Orleans, using a number of local people to fill various roles and making intelligent use of improvisation. As a result, the characters and dialogue both seem very natural and believable. An important deadline which has to be met in order to avoid a disaster, provides the story with its great sense of urgency and pace and the problems which delay the necessary action from being taken, then increase the tension to a high level.<br /><br />Following a dispute between the participants in a card game, a man called Kochak (Lewis Charles) is shot and his body is dumped in the dock area. When the body is found and the coroner identifies the presence of a virus, U.S. Public Health official Dr Clinton Reed (Richard Widmark) is called in and his examination confirms the presence of pneumonic plague. Reed insists that all known contacts of the dead man must be inoculated without delay because the very infectious nature of the disease means that without such action, anyone infected could be expected to die within days.<br /><br />As the identity of the dead man is unknown, the task of finding his contacts is expected to be difficult and this situation is not helped when city officials and the Police Commissioner are not fully convinced by Reed\\'s briefing. They doubt that the threat to the public is potentially as serious as he claims it is and their initial lack of commitment is just the first of a series of obstacles which prevent action from being taken urgently. The investigation that follows is hampered by a lack of cooperation from the immigrant community, a group of seamen, the proprietor of a restaurant and also some illegal immigrants before the man\\'s identity and his contacts are eventually found.<br /><br />Kochak, an illegal immigrant, had been in a gang with Blackie (Jack Palance), Raymond Fitch (Zero Mostel) and Vince Poldi (Tommy Cook) and when gang leader Blackie becomes aware of the ongoing police investigation, he presumes that Kochak must\\'ve smuggled something very valuable into the country. As Kochak and Poldi were related, Blackie assumes that Poldi must know something about this and goes to find out more. Poldi, however, is very ill and unable to provide any information. Blackie brings in his own doctor and together with Fitch starts to move Poldi out of his room and down some stairs and this is when they meet up with Reed and an exciting chase follows.<br /><br />Richard Widmark gives a strong performance as an underpaid public official who copes efficiently with the onerous responsibilities of his job whilst also dealing with his domestic preoccupations as a family man. In an unusual type of role for him, he also portrays the determined and serious minded nature of Dr Reed very convincingly. Jack Palance\\'s film debut sees him giving an impressive performance as a ruthless thug who misjudges Kochak\\'s reason for leaving the card game and also the reason for the intense police investigation. His distinctive looks also help to make his on-screen presence even more compelling.<br /><br />In typical docu-noir style, expressionist cinematography and neo-realist influences are utilized in tandem to effectively capture the atmosphere of the locations in which the action takes place. Elia Kazan directs with precision throughout but also excels in the memorable chase sequence in the warehouse and on the dockside.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"Way, way back in the 1980s, long before NAFTA was drafted and corporations began to shed their national identities, the United States and Japan were at each other\\'s throat in the world manufacturing race. Remember sayings like \\'Union Yes!,\\' \\'the Japanese are taking this country over,\\' and \\'Americans are lazy?\\'<br /><br />As the Reagan era winded down and corporations edged towards a global marketplace, director Ron Howard made one of several trips into the comedy genre with his 1986 smash \\'Gung Ho,\\' which drew over $36 million in U.S. box office receipts. While in many ways dated, Howard\\'s tongue-in-cheek story of colliding cultures in the workplace still offers hard truth for industrial life today.<br /><br />\\'Gung Ho\\' focuses on Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton), the automakers union rep from Hadleyville, a small, depressed town in the foothills of Pennsylvania. Stevenson has been asked to visit the Assan Motor Company in Tokyo (similar to real-life Toyota), which is considering a U.S. operation at the town\\'s empty plant. With hundreds of residents out of work and the town verging on collapse, Assan decides to move in and Stevenson is hired as a liaison between company officials and workers on the assembly line.<br /><br />The 112 minutes of \\'Gung Ho\\' is a humorous look at these two sides, with their strengths and weaknesses equally considered: on one hand, an American workforce that values its traditions but is often caught in the frenzy of pride and trade unionism; on the other hand, Japanese workers who are extremely devoted to their job yet lacking in personal satisfaction and feelings of self-worth. In Stevenson, we find an American working class figure of average intelligence with the skills to chat people through misunderstandings. With the survival of his workers\\' jobs and most of Hadleyville on the line, Stevenson proves a likable guy who wants nothing more than a fair chance, although his cleverness will sink him into a great deal of trouble. Besides answering to the heads of Assan, we witness a delicate balancing act between Stevenson and his fellow union members, many of whom he grew up with. This includes Buster (George Wendt), Willie (John Turturro), and Paul (Clint Howard, Ron\\'s brother).<br /><br />The Japanese cast is headed by Gedde Watanabe, also known for \\'Sixteen Candles\\' and \\'Volunteers.\\' Watanabe plays Kazihiro, the plant manager who is down on his luck and begins to feel a sympathy for American life. He is constantly shadowed by Saito (Sab Shimono), the nephew of Assan\\'s CEO who is desperate to take his spot in the pecking order. While given a light touch, these characters fare very well in conveying ideas of the Japanese working culture.<br /><br />With Hunt Stevenson dominating the script, Michael Keaton has to give a solid performance for this film to work. \\'Gung Ho\\' is indeed a slam-dunk success for Keaton, who also teamed with Ron Howard in 1994\\'s \\'The Paper.\\' He made this film during a string of lighter roles that included \\'Mr. Mom,\\' \\'Beetle Juice,\\' and \\'The Dream Team\\' before venturing into \\'Batman,\\' \\'One Good Cop,\\' and \\'My Life.\\' It\\'s also hard not to like Gedde Watanabe\\'s performance as the odd man out, who first wears Japanese ribbons of shame before teaming up with Stevenson to make the auto plant a cohesive unit.<br /><br />The supporting cast is top-notch, including Wendt, Turturro, Shimono, and Soh Yamamura as Assan CEO Sakamoto. Mimi Rogers supplies a romantic interest as Audrey, Hunt\\'s girlfriend. Edwin Blum, Lowell Ganz, and Babaloo Mandel teamed up for Gung Ho\\'s solid writing. The incidental music, which received a BMI Film Music Award, was composed by Thomas Newman. Gung Ho\\'s soundtrack songs are wall-to-wall 80s, including \\'Don\\'t Get Me Wrong,\\' \\'Tuff Enuff,\\' and \\'Working Class Man.\\'<br /><br />The success of \\'Gung Ho\\' actually led to a short-lived TV series on ABC. While more impressive as a social commentary twenty years ago, Ron Howard\\'s film still has its comic value. It is available on DVD as part of the Paramount Widescreen Collection and is a tad short-changed. Audio options are provided in English 5.1 surround, English Dolby surround, and French \\'dubbing,\\' but subtitles are in English only. There are no extras, not even the theatrical trailer.

       "  '\"The premise of the story is simple: An old man living alone in the woods accidentally stumble upon a murder of a small child, and tries to convince the police that the murder has occurred. Though very little dialog is provided throughout the film, the visual narrative told by the camera\\'s eye alone made the film quite engaging. The setting of the gray woods conveys a feeling of loneliness, which complements the quietness of the characters themselves. We can also sense helplessness in the old man\\'s inability to convince the police of the murder, which parallels the silenced child\\'s inability to tell her own story.<br /><br />True horror lies in feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, and irrationality. This film successfully addresses these elements by visuals alone, rather than relying on cheap sound effects or blood and gore that other bad horror films use when the narrative is weak.<br /><br />Cleverly, the story unfolds at a slow pace to build up tension for a few creepy and startling moments. The ending is also unexpected and believable. Reminiscent of Japanese horror films, such as \\\\\"The Ring,\\\\\" and \\\\\"Dark Water,\\\\\" or English horror films, such as \\\\\"Lady in Black,\\\\\" and \\\\\"The Innocents,\\\\\" this film provides viewers the experience of true atmosphere horror.

Aside from the fact that the main character is a well endowed blonde running around Hell in a leather bikini with occasional spurts of graphic violence, the movie seems to have been made with the mentality of a 1980\\'s cartoon based on a line of action figures. The bad guy himself even talks like a Skeletor wannabe, has the obligatory inept henchman, and lives in a lair that looks to have been patterned after the domain of the villain from the old Saturday morning Blackstar cartoon. Just don\\'t expect any humor other than the sometimes howlingly bad dialogue. At other times it feels like the kind of anime tale better suited to hentai, yet there is no sex, no tentacle rape (Thank goodness!) and very little sex appeal, this despite the physical appearance of the title character. There is simply no adult edge to this material, unless you count the half-naked heroine and bloody deaths.

       "  '\"A noted cinematic phenomenon of the late eighties and early nineties was the number of Oscars which went to actors playing characters who were either physically or mentally handicapped. The first was Marlee Matlin\\'s award for \\\\\"Children of a Lesser God\\\\\" in 1986, and the next ten years were to see another \\\\\"Best Actress\\\\\" award (Holly Hunter for \\\\\"The Piano\\\\\" in 1994) and no fewer than five \\\\\"Best Actor\\\\\" awards (Dustin Hoffman in 1988 for \\\\\"Rain Man\\\\\", Daniel Day-Lewis in 1989 for \\\\\"My Left Foot\\\\\", Al Pacino in 1992 for \\\\\"Scent of a Woman\\\\\", Tom Hanks in 1994 for \\\\\"Forrest Gump\\\\\" and Geoffrey Rush in 1996 for \\\\\"Shine\\\\\") for portrayals of the disabled. Matlin, who played a deaf woman, is herself deaf, but all the others are able-bodied. <br /><br />This phenomenon aroused some adverse comment at the time, with suggestions being made that these awards were given more for political correctness than for the quality of the acting. When Jodie Foster failed to win \\\\\"Best Actress\\\\\" for \\\\\"Nell\\\\\" in 1994 some people saw this as evidence of a backlash against this sort of portrayal. My view, however, is that the majority of these awards were well deserved. I thought the 1992 award should have gone to either Clint Eastwood or Robert Downey rather than Pacino, but apart from that the only one with which I disagreed would have been Hanks\\', and that was because I preferred Nigel Hawthorne\\'s performance in \\\\\"The Madness of King George\\\\\". In that film, of course, Hawthorne played a character who was mentally ill. <br /><br />\\\\\"My Left Foot\\\\\" was based upon the autobiography of the Irish writer and painter Christy Brown. Brown was born in 1931, one of the thirteen children of a working-class Dublin family. He was born with cerebral palsy and was at first wrongly thought to be mentally handicapped as well. He was for a long time incapable of deliberate movement or speech, but eventually discovered that he could control the movements of one part of his body, his left foot (hence the title). He learned to write and draw by holding a piece of chalk between his toes, and went on to become a painter and a published novelist and poet. <br /><br />Life in working-class Dublin in the thirties and forties could be hard, and the city Jim Sheridan (himself a Dubliner) shows us here is in many ways a grim, grey, cheerless place, very different from our normal idea of the \\\\\"Emerald Isle\\\\\". (Sheridan and Day-Lewis were later to collaborate on another film with an Irish theme, \\\\\"In the Name of the Father\\\\\"). Against this, however, must be set the cheerfulness and spirit of its people, especially the Brown family. Much of Christy\\'s success was due to the support he received from his parents, who refused to allow him to be institutionalised and always believed in the intelligence hidden beneath a crippled exterior, and from his siblings. We see how his brothers used to wheel him round in a specially-made cart and how they helped their bricklayer father to build Christy a room of his own in their back yard. <br /><br />The film could easily have slid into sentimentality and ended up as just another heart-warming \\\\\"triumph over adversity\\\\\" movie. That it does not is due to a number of factors, principally the magnificent acting. In the course of his career, Day-Lewis has given a number of fine performances, but this, together with the recent \\\\\"There Will Be Blood\\\\\", is his best. He is never less than 100% convincing as Christie; his tortured, jerky movements and strained attempts at speech persuade us that we really are watching a disabled person, even though, intellectually, we are well aware that Day-Lewis is able-bodied. The other performances which stand out are from Fiona Shaw as his mentor Dr Eileen Cole, from Hugh O\\'Conor as the young Christy and from Brenda Fricker as Christy\\'s mother (which won her the \\\\\"Best Supporting Actress\\\\\" award). <br /><br />The other reason why the film escapes sentimentality is that it does not try to sentimentalise its main character. Christy Brown had a difficult life, but he could also be difficult to live with, and the film gives us a \\\\\"warts and all\\\\\" portrait. He was a heavy drinker, given to foul language and prone to outbursts of rage. He could also be selfish and manipulative of those around him, and the film shows us all these aspects of his character. Of course, it also shows us the positive aspects- his courage, his determination and his wicked sense of humour. Day-Lewis\\'s acting is not just physically convincing, in that it persuades us to believe in his character\\'s disability, but also emotionally and intellectually convincing, in that it brings out all these different facets of Christy\\'s character. His Oscar was won in the teeth of some very strong opposition from the likes of Robin Williams and Kenneth Branagh, but it was well deserved. 8/10\"'],\n",

For every \\\\\"Godfather II,\\\\\" there are dozens of \\\\\"More American Graffiti\\'s,\\\\\" \\\\\"Stayin\\' Alives,\\\\\" and \\\\\"Grease 2\\'s.\\\\\" While the original \\\\\"Grease\\\\\" is not a great film, the 1977 adaptation of the long-running Broadway hit does have songs evocative of the 1960\\'s, energetic choreography, and an appealing cast. When Paramount began work on a follow-up, the producers came up nearly empty on every aspect that made the original a blockbuster.<br /><br />Fortunately for moviegoers, Michelle Pfeiffer survived this experience and evidently learned to read scripts before signing contracts. Her talent and beauty were already evident herein, and Pfeiffer does seem to express embarrassment at the humiliating dance routines and tuneless songs that she is forced to perform. Maxwell Caulfield, however, lacks even the skill to express embarrassment, and his emotions run the gamut from numb to catatonic. What romantic interest, beyond hormones, could the cool sassy Pfeiffer have in the deadpan Caulfield? That dull mystery will linger long after the ludicrous luau finale fades into a bad memory. Only cameos by veterans such as Eve Arden, Connie Stevens, and Sid Caesar have any wit, although Lorna Luft does rise slightly above the lame material.<br /><br />Reviewers have complained that, because \\\\\"Grease 2\\\\\" is always compared to the original, the movie comes up lacking. However, even taken on its own terms, the film is a clunker. After a frenetic opening number, which evidently exhausted the entire cast, the energy dissipates. With few exceptions, the original songs bear little resemblance to the early 1960\\'s, and the only nostalgia evoked is for \\\\\"Our Miss Brooks\\\\\" and \\\\\"Sid Caesar\\'s Comedy Hour.\\\\\" The jokes fall flat, and the choreography in a film directed by choreographer Patricia Birch is clumsy to be polite. However, worse films have been inflicted on audiences, and inept sequels will be made as long as producers seek to milk a quick buck from rehashing blockbusters. Unfortunately, \\\\\"Grease 2\\\\\" is not even unintentionally funny. Instead, the film holds the viewer\\'s attention like a bad train wreck. Just when all the bodies seem to have been recovered, the next scene plunges into even worse carnage.\"'],\n",

The criminal role of religion is surprisingly well shown in one of the most inventive scenes that Uribe ever made. The colors are magnificent.

It\\'s a \\\\\"fish out of water\\\\\" story, but unlike most movies of this sort, this time it\\'s the \\\\\"fish\\\\\" who has the upper hand.

I would delve further into this suspicious trend, but alas, this is a review of the movie, and not the reviews themselves.<br /><br />Let me start by saying that I am both a Christian and a true avid movie fan. This means I have seen a great many movies, from good to bad, and can wholeheartedly claim that Facing The Giants is, in fact, NOT a good movie. It has good intentions, but fails to meet many (if any) basic standards that I associate with a quality filmgoing experience.<br /><br />The Acting: Mostly Terrible, Palatable At Best. Hearing that most were apparently volunteers does not at all surprise me.<br /><br />The Dialogue: Clumsy, cheesy, the script comes off as a long version of some cheesy skit you\\'d see performed in Sunday School or youth group function. The Rave Review Robots revel in the absence of \\\\\"meaningless words\\\\\", but the cold hard truth is that such words are a part of the real world, and the complete absence of it is palpable. Let\\'s just say the mean ol\\' head coach of a team in a State Championship game would have a lot more to say than \\\\\"OH NO!\\\\\" when things are not going his way.<br /><br />The Plot: Mind-bogglingly predictable. It has been commented that this movie is \\\\\"not a Hollywood cliché\\\\\", and yet it\\'s like it was pulled directly from Making An Underdog Sports Movie For Dummies (including the mandatory quasi-romantic subplot for the ladies) and just had a Christian-themed coat of paint slapped on it. I\\'m not lying or bragging when I say I had almost every major detail in both the plot and subplot pegged immediately upon their inception. Only someone who has never seen a decent sports movie in their whole life would be emotionally stirred by the story presented here.<br /><br />The Directing/Editing: It, too, was patterned almost exactly after the generic Underdog Sports Movie template. Still, acting aside, there weren\\'t many noticeable goofs, so at least Facing The Giants was technically competent.<br /><br />The Message: Ask Jesus and He will grant all your wishes. Part of me hoped that this movie would end in the team\\'s eventual defeat to really emphasize the whole \\\\\"If we lose, we praise You\\\\\" part, because in the Real World, you WILL fail at one point or another and it\\'s good to be prepared for that. But in the world of Facing The Giants, if you fail, clearly someone either screwed up or is cheating. Another interesting question being, what if the Eagles came across another team that had gotten religion? Would they be caught in an endless loop of miraculous plays and last-minute saves, or would the universe simply have exploded? <br /><br />The Bottom Line: For the hardcore conservative Christian Parents crowd lamenting the evils of Hollywood, Facing The Giants will be another mediocre-at-best Christian film to hold up on a pedestal as the preferred model for modern film-making. For everyone else, the effects will range from boredom to a burning desire to be watching something else. And a warning: Any attempt to show this to non-Christians will lead not to conversion, but to derision. I give this two stars, one for the one scene that did not have me rolling my eyes, and another for basic technical proficiency on a low budget.\"'],\n",

Would Stan and Ollie do fart gags if they were alive today? Would they glass mummies with broken bottles? Have Stan being smacked in the genitals with a spear and end on a big CGI-finale?

       "  '\"The story of Ned Kelly has been enshrouded in myth and exaggeration for time out of hand, and this film is no exception. What ensures Ned Kelly has a permanent place in history is the effort he went to in order to even the odds against the policemen hunting him. During several battles, he marched out wearing plates of beaten iron, off which the bullets available to police at the time would harmlessly bounce. Indeed, it is only because there were a few bright sparks among the Victorian police who noticed he hadn\\'t plated up his legs that he was captured and hanged. The story has been told in schools and histories of Australia for so long that some permutations of the story have, ironically, become boring. The more the stories try to portray Kelly as some inhuman or superhuman monster, the less people pay attention.<br /><br />Which is where this adaptation of Our Sunshine, a novel about the Kelly legend, excels. Rather than attempting to portray a Ned Kelly who is as unfeeling as the armour he wore, the film quickly establishes him as a human being. Indeed, the reversal of the popular legend, showing the corruption of the Victorian police and the untenable situation of the colonists, goes a long way to make this film stand out from the crowd. Here, Ned Kelly is simply a human being living in a time and place where in order to be convicted of murder, one simply had to be the nearest person to the corpse when a policeman found it. No, I am not making that up. About the only area where the film errs is by exaggerating the Irish versus English mentality of the battles. While the Kelly gang were distinctly Irish, Australia has long been a place where peoples of wildly varied ethnicities have mixed together almost seamlessly (a scene with some Chinese migrants highlights this).<br /><br />Heath Ledger does an amazing job of impersonating Australia\\'s most notorious outlaw. It is only because of the fame he has found in other films that the audience is aware they are watching Ledger and not Kelly himself. Orlando Bloom has finally found a role in which he doesn\\'t look completely lost without his bow, and Geoffrey Rush\\'s appearance as the leader of the police contingent at Glenrowan goes to show why he is one of the most revered actors in that desolate little island state. But it is Naomi Watts, appearing as Julia Cook, who gets a bit of a bum deal in this film. Although the film basically implies that Cook was essentially the woman in Ned Kelly\\'s life, but you would not know that from the minimal screen time that she gets here. Indeed, a lot of the film\\'s hundred and ten minutes feels more freeze-dried than explorative. Once the element of police corruption is established, in fact, the film rockets along so fast at times that it almost feels rushed.<br /><br />Unfortunately, most of the film\\'s strengths are not capitalised upon. Rush barely gets more screen time than his name does in the opening and closing credits. Ditto for Watts, and the rest of the cast come off a little like mannequins. I can only conclude that another fifteen, or even thirty, minutes of footage might have fixed this. But that leads to the other problem, in that the lack of any depth or background to characters other than the titular hero leaves the events of the story with zero impact. One scene manages to do the speech-making thing well, but unfortunately, it all becomes a collage of moments with no linking after a while. If one were to believe the impression that this film creates, a matter of weeks, even days, passes between the time that Ned Kelly becomes a wanted man on the say-so of one corrupt policeman, and the infamous shootout at Glenrowan. Annoyingly, the trial and execution of Ned Kelly is not even depicted here, simply referred to in subtitles before the credits roll.<br /><br />That said, aside from some shaky camera-work at times, Ned Kelly manages to depict some exciting shootouts, and it has a good beginning. For that reason, I rated it a seven out of ten. Other critics have not been so kind, so if you\\'re not impressed by shootouts with unusual elements (and what could more more unusual than full body armour in a colonial shootout?), then you might be better off looking elsewhere. Especially if you want a more factual account of Ned Kelly\\'s life.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"At first glance, it would seem natural to compare Where the Sidewalk Ends with Laura. Both have noirish qualities, both were directed by Otto Preminger, and both star Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney. But that\\'s where most of the comparisons end. Laura dealt with posh, sophisticated people with means who just happen to find themselves mixed-up in a murder. Where the Sidewalk Ends is set in a completely different strata. These are people with barely two nickels to rub together who are more accustomed to seeing the underbelly of society than going to fancy dress parties. Where the Sidewalk ends is a gritty film filled with desperate people who solve their problems with their fists or some other weapon. Small-time hoods are a dime-a-dozen and cops routinely beat confessions out of the crooks. Getting caught-up in a murder investigation seems as natural as breathing.<br /><br />While I haven\\'t seen his entire body of work, based on what I have seen, Dana Andrews gives one of his best performances as the beat-down cop, Det. Sgt. Mark Dixon. He\\'s the kind of cop who is used to roughing up the local hoods if it gets him information or a confession. One night, he goes too far and accidentally kills a man. He does his best to cover it up. But things get complicated when he falls for the dead man\\'s wife, Morgan Taylor (Tierney), whose father becomes suspect number one in the murder case. As Morgan\\'s father means the world to her, Dixon\\'s got to do what he can to clear the old man without implicating himself.<br /><br />Technically, Where the Sidewalk Ends is outstanding. Besides the terrific performance from Andrews, the movie features the always delightful Tierney. She has a quality that can make even the bleakest of moments seem brighter. The rest of the cast is just as solid with Tom Tully as the wrongly accused father being a real standout. Beyond the acting, the direction, sets, lighting, and cinematography are all top-notch. Overall, it\\'s an amazingly well made film.<br /><br />If I have one complaint (and admittedly it\\'s a very, very minor quibble) it\\'s that Tierney is almost too perfect for the role and her surroundings. It\\'s a little difficult to believe that a woman like that could find herself mixed-up with some of these unsavory characters. It\\'s not really her fault, it\\'s just the way Tierney comes across. She seems a little too beautiful, polished, and delicate for the part. But, her gentle, kind, trusting nature add a sense of needed realism to her portrayal.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"The penultimate episode of Star Trek\\'s third season is excellent and a highlight of the much maligned final season. Essentially, Spock, McCoy and Kirk beam down to Sarpeidon to find the planet\\'s population completely missing except for the presence of a giant library and Mr. Atoz, the librarian. All 3 Trek characters soon accidentally walk into a time travel machine into different periods of Sarpeidon\\'s past. Spock gives a convincing performance as an Ice Age Vulcan who falls in love for Zarabeth while Kirk reprises his unhappy experience with time travel--see the \\'City on the Edge of Forever\\'--when he is accused of witchcraft and jailed before escaping and finding the doorway back in time to Sarpeidon\\'s present. In the end, all 3 Trek characters are saved mere minutes before the Beta Niobe star around Sarpeidon goes supernova. The Enterprise warps away just as the star explodes.<br /><br />Ironically, as William Shatner notes in his book \\\\\"Star Trek Memories,\\\\\" this show was the source of some dispute since Leonard Nimoy noticed that no reason was given in Lisette\\'s script for the reason why Spock was behaving in such an emotional way. Nimoy relayed his misgivings here directly to the show\\'s executive producer, Fred Freiberger, that Vulcans weren\\'t supposed to fall in love. (p.272) However, Freiberger reasoned, the ice age setting allowed Spock to experience emotions since this was a time when Vulcans still had not evolved into their completely logical present state. This was a great example of improvisation on Freiberger\\'s part to save a script which was far above average for this particular episode. While Shatner notes that the decline in script quality for the third season hurt Spock artistically since his character was forced to bray like a donkey in \\\\\"Plato\\'s Stepchildren,\\\\\" play music with Hippies in \\\\\"the Way to Eden\\\\\" or sometimes display emotion, the script here was more believable. Spock\\'s acting here was excellent as Freiberger candidly admitted to Shatner. (p.272) The only obvious plot hole is the fact that since both Spock and McCoy travelled thousands of years back in time, McCoy too should have reverted to a more primitive human state, not just Spock. But this is a forgivable error considering the poor quality of many other season 3 shows, the brilliant Spock/McCoy performance and the originality of this script. Who could have imagined that the present inhabitants of Sarpeidon would escape their doomed planet\\'s fate by travelling into their past? This is certainly what we came to expect from the best of \\'Classic Trek\\'--a genuinely inspired story. <br /><br />Shatner, in \\'Memories\\', named some of his best \\\\\"unusual and high quality shows\\\\\" of season 3 as The Enterprise Incident, Day of the Dove, Is there in Truth no Beauty, The Tholian Web, And the children Shall Lead and The Paradise Syndrome. (p.273) While my personal opinion is that \\'And the children Shall Lead\\' is a very poor episode while \\'Is there in Truth no Beauty\\' is problematic, \\\\\"All Our Yesterdays\\\\\" certainly belongs on the list of top season three Star Trek TOS films. I give a 9 out of 10 for \\'All Our Yesterdays.\\'\"'],\n",

Heinlein\\'s \\'All You Zombies\\' was written decades ago and yet it will still spin out people reading that short story for the first time.<br /><br />In the case of Terry Gilliam\\'s excellent film, \\'12 Monkeys\\', it\\'s hard to establish what may be continuity problems versus plot elements intended to make us re-think our conception of the film. Repeated viewings will drive us to different conclusions if we retain an open mind.<br /><br />Some, seeing the film for the first time, will regard Cole, played by Bruce Willis, as a schizophrenic. Most will see Cole as a man disturbed by what Adams describes as \\'the continual wrenching of experience\\' visited upon him by time travel.<br /><br />Unlike other time travel stories, \\'12 Monkeys\\' is unclear as to whether future history can be changed by manipulating events in the past. Cole tells his psychiatrist, Railly (Madeleine Stowe), that time cannot be changed, but a phone call he makes from the airport is intercepted by scientists AFTER he has been sent back to 1996, in his own personal time-line.<br /><br />Even this could be construed as an event that had to happen in a single time-line universe, in order to ensure that the time-line is not altered...Cole has to die before the eyes of his younger self for fate to be realised. If that\\'s the case, time is like a fluid, it always finds its own level or path, irrespective of the external forces working on it. It boggles the mind to dwell on this sort of thing too much.<br /><br />If you can change future events that then guide the actions of those with the power to send people back in time, as we see on board the plane at the end of the film, then that means the future CAN be changed by manipulating past events...or does it? The film has probably led to plenty of drunken brawls at bars frequented by physicists and mathematicians.<br /><br />Bonus material on the DVD makes for very interesting viewing. Gilliam was under more than normal pressure to bring the film in under budget, which is no particular surprise after the \\'Munchausen\\' debacle and in light of his later attempt to film \\'Don Quixote\\'. I would rate the \\'making of\\' documentary as one of the more interesting I\\'ve seen. It certainly is no whitewash and accurately observes the difficulties and occasional conflict arising between the creative people involved. Gilliam\\'s description of the film as his \\\\\"7½th\\\\\" release, on account of the film being written by writers other than himself - and therefore, not really \\'his\\' film\\' - doesn\\'t do the film itself justice.<br /><br />Brad Pitt\\'s portrayal of Goines is curiously engaging, although his character is not especially sympathetic. Watch for his slightly wall-eyed look in one of the scenes from the asylum. It\\'s disturbing and distracting.<br /><br />Probably a coincidence, the Louis Armstrong song \\'What a Wonderful World\\' was used at the end of both \\'12 Monkeys\\' and the final episode of the TV series of \\'The Hitchhiker\\'s Guide to the Galaxy\\'. Both the film and the TV series also featured British actor Simon Jones.<br /><br />\\'12 Monkeys\\' is a science fiction story that will entertain in the same way that the mental stimulation of a game of chess may entertain.

Kazan as always gets fine performances from his actors but also shows a visual flair for claustrophobic suspense with a combination of tight compositions and stunning single shot chase scenes. <br /><br />A man entering the country illegally is killed after a card game. It turns out he has a form of bubonic plague so it remains crucial not only to arrest the killers but to find an inoculate all those who have had contact. City and health officials implement a plan of secrecy rather than alert the community for fear the culprits will flee the city and spread the disease. A detective and an epidemiologist up against the clock form an uneasy alliance as they comb the waterfront employing their contrasting investigatory styles. <br /><br />Streets raises a huge ethical question about the publics right to know as the medical officer argues for a media blackout thus possibly creating a greater risk to the community. Regardless of outcome, you still may find yourself second guessing the actions of the the film\\'s protagonist. <br /><br />Richard Widmark as Dr.Clint Reed and Paul Douglas as Detective Warren display short tempers and grudging respect for each other in their search for the killers. Barbera Bel Geddis as Reed\\'s wife has some good moments with Widmark in some domestic scenes that bring the right touch of (restful more than comic) relief from the tensions of the desperate search amid the grim environs of the New Orleans waterfront impressively lensed by cinematographer Joe McDonald. Zero Mostel as a small time criminal is slimy and reprehensible but at times sympathetic. Walter Jack Palance as the skeletal Blackie (Black Death?) is simply outstanding. With riveting intensity Palance dominates every scene he is in not only with ample threat but disturbing charm as well. In addition he displays a formidable athleticism that allows for a more suspenseful continuity, especially in the film\\'s powerful final allegorical moments. <br /><br />Panic in the Streets is probably Kazan\\'s best non-Brando film. It\\'s tension filled, suspensefully well paced and edited. It\\'s ambient on locale setting lends a sense of heightened reality that allows Kazan the flexibility to display his visual style beyond the movie stage and with Panic he succeeds with aplomb.\"'],\n",

Anglo-American policy makers chose to so act due to their perception that the islands would be strategically vital bases for controlling the Indian Ocean through the projection of aerial and naval power. At a time during the Cold War when most newly independent post-colonial states were moving away from the Western orbit, it seems British and American officials rather felt that allowing the islanders to decide the fate of the islands was not a viable option. Instead they chose to effect the wholesale forcible removal of the native population. The film shows that no provision was made for the islanders at the point of their ejection, and that from the dockside in Mauritius where they were left, the displaced Chagossian community fell into three decades of privation, and in these new circumstances, beset by homesickness, they suffered substantially accelerated rates of death.<br /><br />Following the passage of more than three decades, however, in recent months (and years), following the release of many utterly damning papers from Britain\\'s Public Record Office (one rather suspects that there was some mistake, and these papers were not supposed to have ever been made public), resultant legal appeals by the Chagossian community in exile have seen British courts consistently find in favour of the islanders and against the British State. As such, the astonishing and troubling conclusions drawn out in the film can only reasonably be seen as proved. Nevertheless, the governments of Great Britain and the United States have thus far made no commitment to return the islands to what the courts have definitively concluded are the rightful inhabitants. This is a very worthwhile film for anyone to see, but it is an important one for Britons and Americans to watch.

       "  '\"Sidney Young (Pegg) moves from England to New York to work for the popular magazine Sharpe\\'s in a hope to live his dream lifestyle but struggles to make a lasting impression.<br /><br />Based on Toby Young\\'s book about survival in American business, this comedy drama received mixed views from critiques. Labelled as inconsistently funny but with charm by the actors, how to lose friends seemed as a run of the mill fish out of the pond make fun at another culture comedy, but it isn\\'t.<br /><br />This 2008 picture works on account of its actors and the simple yet sharp story. We start off in the past, then in the present and are working our way forwards to see how Young made his mark at one of America\\'s top magazines.<br /><br />Pegg (Hot Fuzz) is too likable for words. Whether it\\'s hitting zombies with a cricket bat or showing his sidekick the nature of the law the English actor brings a charm and light heartedness to every scene. Here, when the scripting is good but far from his own standards, he brings a great deal of energy to the picture and he alone is worth watching for. His antics with \\\\\"Babe 3\\\\\" are unforgivable, simply breathtaking stuff as is his over exuberant dancing, but he pulls it off splendidly.<br /><br />Bridges and Anderson do well at portraying the stereotypical magazine bosses where Dunst fits in nicely to the confused love interest. Megan Fox, who stole Transformers, reminds everyone she can act here with a funny hyperbole of a stereotype film star. The fact that her character Sophie Myles is starring in a picture about Mother Teresa is as laughable as her character\\'s antics in the pool. To emphasize the point there is a dog, and Pegg rounds that off in true Brit style comedy, with a great little twist.<br /><br />Though a British film there is an adaptation of American lifestyle for Young as he tries to fit in and we can see the different approaches to story telling. Young wants the down right dirty contrasted with the American professionalism. The inclusion of modern day tabloid stars will soon make this film dated but the concept of exploitation of film star\\'s gives this edge.<br /><br />Weide\\'s first picture is not perfect. There are lapses in concentration as the plot becomes too soapy with an awkward obvious twist and there are too many characters to be necessary. The physical comedy can also be overdone. As a side note, the bloopers on the DVD are some of the finest you will ever see, which are almost half an hour long.<br /><br />This comedy drama has Simon Pegg on shining form again and with the collective approach to story telling and sharp comedy, it is worth watching.\"'],\n",

In QUICK & DEAD, Sharon Stone\\'s character seeks revenge against the dastardly sheriff (played by Gene Hackman) who, when she was but an urchin, placed the fate of her father (a brief cameo by Gary Sinise) in her hands; she accidentally shot him through the head. In GUN CRAZY, Saki (played by the nimble Ryoko Yonekura) seeks revenge against the dastardly Mr. Tojo (played with minimalist appeal by Shingo Tsurumi), who, when she was but an urchin, placed the fate of her father in her hands; she let her foot slip off the clutch, and dear ole dad was drawn and quartered by a semi truck. The only significant difference, despite the settings, is the fact that Tojo sadistically cripples Saki with \\x85 well, I won\\'t spoil that for you in case you decide to watch it.<br /><br />In short, Saki \\x96 a pale imitation of the Clint Eastwood\\'s \\'Man With No Name\\' \\x96 rides into the town \\x96 basically, there\\'s a auto shop and a tavern alongside an American military base, so I guess that suffices for a town \\x96 corrupted by Tojo, the local crimelord with a ridiculously high price on his head for reasons never explained or explored. Confessing her true self as a bounty hunter, Saki takes on the local gunmen in shootouts whose choreography bares more than a passing similarity to the works of Johnny To and John Woo. Of course, by the end of the film Saki has endured her fair amount of torture at the hands of the bad guys, but she rises to the occasion \\x96 on her knees, in a laughable attempt at a surprise ending \\x96 and vanquishes all of her enemies with a rocket launcher.<br /><br />Don\\'t ask where she gets the rocket launcher. Just watch it for yourself. Try not to laugh.<br /><br />The image quality is average for the DVD release.

I have no idea why but I trusted Sexo, Pudor y Lagrimas to be the one to inject freshness and confidence to our non-existent industry. Maybe it was because the soundtrack(which I listened to before I saw the film) sounded different from others, maybe it was because it dared to include newer faces(apart from Demian Bichir who is always a favorite of mexican film directors) and supposedly dealed within it\\'s script with modern social behaviour, maybe because it\\'s photography I saw in the trailers was bright and realistic instead of theatrical.

And yeah, he\\'s been smacking around suspects for too long, and the newly promoted chief (Karl Malden, in a typically robust and commanding outing) is warning him \\\\\"for the last time.\\\\\" <br /><br />Yet Dixon hates these thugs too much to stop now. And boy didn\\'t they had have it coming? <br /><br />\\\\\"Hoods, dusters, mugs, gutter nickel-rats\\\\\" he spits when that tough nut of a boss demotes him and rolls out all of the complaints the bureau has been receiving about Dixon\\'s right hook. The advice is for him to cool off for his own good. But instead he takes matters into his own hands. <br /><br />And what a world of trouble he finds when he relies on his instincts, and falls back on a nature that may or may not have been passed down from a generation before. <br /><br />Right away he\\'s in deep with the cops, the syndicate, his own partner. Dixon\\'s questionable involvement in a murder \\\\\"investigation\\\\\" threatens his job, makes him wonder whether he is simply as base as those he has sworn to bring in. Like Bogart in \\\\\"Lonely Place,\\\\\" can he \\\\\"escape what he is?\\\\\"<br /><br />When he has nowhere else to turn, he discovers that he has virtually doomed his unexpected relationship with a seraphic beauty (the marvelous Gene Tierney) who seems as if she can turn his barren bachelor\\'s existence into something worth coming home to. <br /><br />The pacing of this superb film is taut and gripping. The group of writers that contributed to the production polished the script to a high gloss -- the dialogue is snappy without disintegrating into dated parody fodder, passionate without becoming melodramatic or sappy. <br /><br />And all of this top-notch direction and acting isn\\'t too slick or buffed to loosen the film\\'s emotional hold. Gene Tierney\\'s angelic, soft-focus beauty is used to great effect. She shows herself to be an actress of considerable range, and her gentle, kind nature is as boundless here as is her psychosis in \\\\\"Leave Her to Heaven.\\\\\" The scenes between Tierney and Andrews\\'s Dixon grow more intense and touching the closer he seems to self-destruction. <br /><br />Near the end of his rope, cut, bruised, and exhausted Dixon summarizes his lot: \\\\\"Innocent people can get into terrible jams, too,..\\\\\" he says. \\\\\"One false move and you\\'re in over your head.\\\\\" <br /><br />Perhaps what makes this film so totally compelling is the sense that things could go wildly wrong for almost anyone -- especially for someone who is trying so hard to do right -- with one slight shift in the wind, one wrong decision or punch, or, most frighteningly, due to factors you have no control over. Noir has always reflected the darkest fears, brought them to the surface. \\\\\"Where the Sidewalk Ends\\\\\" does so in a realistic fashion. <br /><br />(One nit-pick of an aside: This otherwise sterling film has a glaringly poor dub of a blonde model that wouldn\\'t seem out of place on Mystery Science Theater.

In a genre of crass \\\\\"comedy\\\\\" that has become typified by its lack of humor and engaging characters, The 40-Year-Old Virgin offers a colorful cast and an intelligent, heartfelt script that doesn\\'t use its protagonist as the butt-end of cruel jokes. That Andy is still a virgin at forty years old is not as much a joke, in fact, as it is a curiosity.<br /><br />Carell, a veteran of Team Ferrell in Anchorman and an ex-Daily Show castmember, uses the concept of the film to expand his character \\x96 we get to understand why Andy is the way he is. It\\'s the little things that make this film work. When Andy\\'s co-worker at an electronics store asks him what he did for the weekend, Andy describes his failed efforts at cooking. When Andy rides his bike to work, he signals his turns. He doesn\\'t just adorn his home with action figures \\x96 he paints them, and talks to them, and reveals that some of the really old ones have belonged to him since childhood. A lesser comedy wouldn\\'t even begin to focus on all of these things.<br /><br />The plot is fairly simplistic \\x96 Andy\\'s co-worker pals find out he\\'s never had sex and they make it a personal quest of theirs to get him in bed with a woman. It\\'s a childish idea and the film makes no attempt to conceal its juvenility.<br /><br />Andy\\'s friends are a complement to his neurotic nature: David (Paul Rudd) has broken up with his girlfriend over two years ago but is still obsessed with her, Jay (Romany Malco) is a womanizing ladies\\' man and Cal (Seth Rogen) is a tattooed sexaholic. Their attempts at getting Andy in the sack backfire numerous times, and each time leaves Andy feeling less and less optimistic.<br /><br />Finally Andy meets single mom Trish (played by Catherine Keener) and, much to the chagrin of his worrying buddies who claim mothers aren\\'t worth it, he falls in love with her. They begin a relationship and agree to put off having sex for twenty days \\x96 Trish being unaware that Andy is still a virgin.<br /><br />The 40-Year-Old Virgin was directed by Judd Apatow, the man who produced Anchorman and The Cable Guy, and began the short-lived cult TV show Freaks and Geeks. Apatow is renowned for his unique sense of humor, and the script \\x96 co-written by Carell \\x96 offers plenty.<br /><br />However, in the end the most interesting and (indeed surprising) aspect of The 40-Year-Old Virgin is its maturity. By now you are probably well aware that the film received glowing reviews from the critics, and even I was surprised by its warm reception. But after seeing the film, it\\'s easy to understand why. We like Andy. We care about him. He\\'s not just some cardboard cutout sex-comedy cliché \\x96 he\\'s a real, living, breathing person. His neurotic traits combine the best of Woody Allen with childish naivety. His friends are not unlikable jerks and his romance is tumultuous and bittersweet. It strikes a chord with the audience.<br /><br />Although this is far from being a perfect movie and definitely contains some rather crude innuendo and sexual humor, it doesn\\'t offend to the extent that other genre entries might have because we have affection for the people on-screen. The best sex comedies work this way \\x96 from Risky Business to American Pie \\x96 and that is the major difference between something like The 40-Year-Old Virgin and 40 Days and 40 Nights.\"'],\n",

The men joke about how the woman would never be able to handle camping alone at a double date, sparking the token blonde\\'s ambition to leave a week early. Unexpectedly, the men leave the same day and their car breaks down.. They end up arriving in the evening. When the men arrive, they are warned about people disappearing in the forest by a crazy Ralph doppleganger. They ignore the warning and venture into the blackening night and an eighties song plays in the background with lyrics about being murdered in the dark forest. The men get lost.<br /><br />In the next scene we realize that this isn\\'t just another The Burning clone, but a ghost story! The women, scared and lonely are huddling together by the fire. Two children appear in the shadows and decide to play peeping Tom. Well they are obviously ghosts by the way their voices echo! Their mother appears with blood dripping from a hole in her forehead and asks the two ladies if they\\'ve seen her children, before disappearing of course. <br /><br />The children run home to papa and tell him about the two beautiful ladies by the river. This causes quite a stir and he gets up, grabbing his knife from atop the fireplace. \\\\\"Daddy\\'s going hunting,\\\\\" The little girl, exclaims with bad acting. It is apparent here, that the dad isn\\'t a ghost like his children.<br /><br />Freaked out by something in the woods, the token blonde splits, running blindly into the night, carrying a knife. She encounters the father who explains he\\'s starving and it will be quick. This doesn\\'t make sense because of the panther growls we heard earlier (Maybe he\\'s allergic! Are panthers honestly even in California?) She ends up wounding him slightly before getting stabbed in the head. A thunderstorm erupts and the men seek shelter, which turns out to be where papa resides. Clearly someone lives here because there\\'s a fire and something weird is roasting over it. The children appear and warn them of papa, who shows up moments later. They disappear as soon as he arrives.<br /><br />For whatever reason, our killer only goes after females. He invites the men to have something to eat and tells us the story about his ex wife. We are given a flashback of his wife getting caught cheating. The old man doesn\\'t tell them however that he kills her and her lover afterwards, but daydreams about it. We aren\\'t given the reason for the children\\'s demise. The men go to sleep and are left unharmed. The next morning the men discover the empty campground of their wives. After a brief discussion they split up. One is to stay at the campsite, while the other goes and gets help. The one that is going back to his car breaks his leg. We are then reunited with the children as they explain to the surviving woman that they are ghosts who killed themselves from being sad about their mother. They agree to help the woman reunite with her friends<br /><br />The following scene defies the logic of the movie when papa kills the guy waiting at the campsite. He was also dating or married to the blonde. Somehow the children realize he is murdered and tell the woman about it. She decides to see it for herself and obviously runs into the killer. Luckily the children make him stop by threatening to leave him forever. You know where this is going.<br /><br />Overall the movie deserves four stars out of ten, and that\\'s being generous. For all its misgivings, the musical score is well done. It\\'s still watchable too. There are some camera angles that look professional, and some of the sets are done well. The plot is unbelievable. There is such a thing as willing suspension of disbelief, but with the toad 6 miles away; I can\\'t imagine the token blonde would take off like that in the middle of the night. I mean, come on!<br /><br />- Alan \\\\\"Skip\\\\\" Bannacheck\"'],\n",

       "  '\"Somebody owes Ang Lee an apology. Actually, a lot of people do. And I\\'ll start. I was never interested in the Ang Lee film Hulk, because of the near unanimous bad reviews. Even the premium cable channels seemed to rarely show it. I finally decided to watch it yesterday on USA network and, wow....<br /><br />SPOILERS FOR ANG LEE\\'S HULK AND THE INCREDIBLE HULK <br /><br />Was it boring! I almost didn\\'t make it through Ang Lee\\'s Hulk. Eric Bana was expressionless, Nick Nolte was horrible, Sam Elliott was unlikeable (and that\\'s no fun, he\\'s usually a cool character). In fact, I honestly think they chose Eric Bana because his non-descript face was the easiest to mimic with computer graphics - and it was clear that the Ang Lee Hulk was meant to facially resemble Bruce Banner in his non-angry state. When Hulk fought a mutant poodle I was ready to concede Hulk as the worst superhero movie ever.<br /><br />But then something happened. About 3/4 of the way through this tedious movie, there was a genuinely exciting and - dare I say it - reasonably convincing - extended action scene that starts with Hulk breaking out of a containment chamber in a military base, fighting M1 tanks and Comanche helicopters in the desert, then riding an F22 Raptor into the stratosphere, only to be captured on the streets of San Francisco. This was one of the best action sequences ever made for a superhero movie. And I have to say, the CGI was quite good. That\\'s not to say that the Hulk was totally convincing. But it didn\\'t require much more suspension of disbelief than is required in a lot of non-superhero action movies. And that\\'s quite a feat.<br /><br />Of course, the ending got really stupid with Bruce Banner\\'s father turning into some sort of shape-shifting villain but the earlier long action sequence put any of Iron Man\\'s brief heroics to shame. And overall, apart from the animated mutant dogs, it really did seem like the CGI in Hulk tried hard to convince you that he was real and really interacting with his environment. It was certainly better than I expected.<br /><br />OK, but what about The Incredible Hulk? Guess what... It\\'s boring too! It has just a few appearances by the Hulk and here\\'s the thing - the CGI in this movie is horrible. Maybe the Hulk in Ang Lee\\'s version looked fake at times and cartoonish at others - but it had its convincing moments also. The Incredible Hulk looked positively ridiculous. It had skin tone and muscle tone that didn\\'t even look like a living creature, just some sort of computer-generated texture. It was really preposterous. The lighting, environment and facial effects didn\\'t look 5 years newer than Ang Lee\\'s, they looked 10 years older. And there really is no excuse for that. We truly are living in an era where computer programmers can ruin a movie just as thoroughly as any director, actor or cinematographer ever could.<br /><br />Worse, the writer and director of this movie seemed to learn almost nothing from Ang Lee\\'s \\\\\"failure\\\\\". All the same mistakes are made. Bruce Banner is practically emotionless. The general is so relentlessly, implausibly one-dimensional that he seems faker than the Hulk. The love interest is unconvincing (I have to give Liv Tyler credit for being more emotional than Jennifer Connelly, though both are quite easy on the eyes). Tim Blake Nelson overacts almost as much as Nick Nolte, even though he\\'s only in the movie for a few minutes. The Hulk really doesn\\'t do much in this movie, certainly not any more than in Ang Lee\\'s version. The Incredible Hulk was slightly more fast-paced, but since nothing really happened anyway that\\'s not worth much. Oh yeah, the villain is every bit as phony looking as the Hulk. He\\'s actually much more interesting as a human than as a monster. <br /><br />This is how I can definitively say Ang Lee\\'s version was better: if I ever have the chance to see Ang Lee\\'s version again, I might be able to sit through it to see the good action sequences, or else to try to appreciate the dialogue a little more (more likely I\\'d just fast forward to the good parts). But there is absolutely not a single scene in The Incredible Hulk that is worth seeing once, let alone twice. It is truly at the bottom of the heap of superhero movies. The cartoonish CGI is an insult to the audience - at least in Ang Lee\\'s version it seems like they were trying to make it realistic (except for the giant poodle, of course).<br /><br />It is absolutely mind-boggling how the filmmakers intended to erase the bad feelings associated with Ang Lee\\'s Hulk by making almost exactly the same movie. <br /><br />It is to Edward Norton\\'s credit that he seems to be distancing himself from this film.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"\\'The Adventures Of Barry McKenzie\\' started life as a satirical comic strip in \\'Private Eye\\', written by Barry Humphries and based on an idea by Peter Cook. McKenzie ( \\'Bazza\\' to his friends ) is a lanky, loud, hat-wearing Australian whose two main interests in life are sex ( despite never having had any ) and Fosters lager. In 1972, he found his way to the big screen for the first of two outings. It must have been tempting for Humphries to cast himself as \\'Bazza\\', but he wisely left the job to Barry Crocker ( later to sing the theme to the television soap opera \\'Neighbours\\'! ). Humphries instead played multiple roles in true Peter Sellers fashion, most notably Bazza\\'s overbearing Aunt \\'Edna Everage\\' ( this was before she became a Dame ).<br /><br />You know this is not going to be \\'The Importance Of Being Ernest\\' when its censorship classification N.P.A. stands for \\'No Poofters Allowed\\'. Pom-hating Bazza is told by a Sydney solicitor that in order to inherit a share in his father\\'s will he must go to England to absorb British culture. With Aunt Edna in tow, he catches a Quantas flight to Hong Kong, and then on to London. An over-efficient customs officer makes Bazza pay import duties on everything he bought over there, including a suitcase full of \\'tubes of Fosters lager\\'. As he puts it: \\\\\"when it comes to fleecing you, the Poms have got the edge on the gyppos!\\\\\". A crafty taxi driver ( Bernard Spear ) maximises the fare by taking Bazza and Edna first to Stonehenge, then Scotland. The streets of London are filthy, and their hotel is a hovel run by a seedy landlord ( Spike Milligan ) who makes Bazza put pound notes in the electricity meter every twenty minutes. There is some good news for our hero though; he meets up with other Aussies in Earls Court, and Fosters is on sale in British pubs.<br /><br />What happens next is a series of comical escapades that take Bazza from starring in his own cigarette commercial, putting curry down his pants in the belief it is some form of aphrodisiac, a bizarre encounter with Dennis Price as an upper-class pervert who loves being spanked while wearing a schoolboy\\'s uniform, a Young Conservative dance in Rickmansworth to a charity rock concert where his song about \\'chundering\\' ( vomiting ) almost makes him an international star, and finally to the B.B.C. T.V. Centre where he pulls his pants down on a live talk-show hosted by the thinking man\\'s crumpet herself, Joan Bakewell. A fire breaks out, and Bazza\\'s friends come to the rescue - downing cans of Fosters, they urinate on the flames en masse.<br /><br />This is a far cry from Bruce Beresford\\'s later works - \\'Breaker Morant\\' and \\'Driving Miss Daisy\\'. On release, it was savaged by critics for being too \\'vulgar\\'. Well, yes, it is, but it is also great non-P.C. fun. \\'Bazza\\' is a disgusting creation, but his zest for life is unmistakable, you cannot help but like the guy. His various euphemisms for urinating ( \\'point Percy at the porcelain\\' ) and vomiting ( \\'the Technicolour yawn\\' ) have passed into the English language without a lot of people knowing where they came from. Other guest stars include Dick Bentley ( as a detective who chases Bazza everywhere ), Peter Cook, Julie Covington ( later to star in \\'Rock Follies\\' ), and even future arts presenter Russell Davies.<br /><br />A sequel - the wonderfully-named \\'Barry McKenzie Holds His Own - came out two years later. At its premiere, Humphries took the opportunity to blast the critics who had savaged the first film. Good for him.<br /><br />What must have been of greater concern to him, though, was the release of \\'Crocodile Dundee\\' in 1985. It also featured a lanky, hat-wearing Aussie struggling to come to terms with a foreign culture. And made tonnes more money.<br /><br />The song on the end credits ( performed by Snacka Fitzgibbon ) is magnificent. You have a love a lyric that includes the line: \\\\\"If you want to send your sister in a frenzy, introduce her to Barry McKenzie!\\\\\". Time to end this review.

It boasts a great stalwart cast, who ham the play up for all they\\'re worth, especially Askey of course. Histrionics were provided by Linden Travers, melodramatics by Herbert Lomas, and pragmatics by Richard Murdoch.<br /><br />The group of rail passengers stranded at the lonely country station for the night find more than they bargained for, ghostly trains, spectral porters, hairy sausage rolls and Arthur trying to entertain them all. His repartee with everyone falls between side-splitting and ghastly dull. When the formula works it\\'s very good, but it sometimes gets very contrived and forced making the film seem more dated than it is.

       "  '\"Either or, I love the suspension of any formulaic plot in this movie. I have re-visited it many times and it always holds up. A little too stylized for some but I fancy that any opera lover will love it. Norman Jewison, a fellow Canadian, takes enormous chances with his movies and his casting and it nearly always pays off in movies that are off centre and somehow delicious, as this one is. I have often wondered at the paucity of Cher\\'s acting roles, whether she has chosen to minimize this part of her life or she does not get enough good roles to chew on. I have found her to be a superb actress who can retreat into a role, as in this particular one or be loud and daring and fierce as in \\\\\"Mask\\\\\". I found the comedic strokes broad at times ( a hair salon called \\\\\"Cinderella\\\\\")but this was the whole intent of both the writer and director. Nicolas Page plays the angst ridden tenor of opera, all extravagant gestures, at one point demanding a knife so as to slit his own throat. The Brooklyn scenes are magical, this is a Brooklyn under moonlight, romanticized and dramatic, just like opera. All in all a very satisfying film not to everyone\\'s taste by a long shot, I loved the ending, everyone brought together like a Greek Chorus, every part subtly nuanced and blending with the others, the camera pulling away down the hall, leaving the players talking. 8 out of 10.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"When a movie of a book seems pointless and incomprehensible, the cause can invariably be found in the book: either it was pointless to start with, or the point is one not easily conveyed to film, or the movie missed the point, which is the most frequent of these results, and the easiest to happen, especially when the point is one not easily defined. The book \\\\\"Morvern Callar\\\\\" has a point; every reader of the book must have felt this, and felt as if he had gotten it; but I suspect most of them could not state it in words. I\\'m not sure I can, myself, but perhaps it comes to this, or something like it: Things come, things go, such is life, but we carry on; or at any rate some of us--people like Morvern--do. No doubt a more erudite critic could construct a more adequate definition. But the important fact is that there is a point--possibly the sum of the entire story is the point--and that this would have been the main thing to keep in view, and to carry over, in adapting the story to film. The maker of this film evidently missed the point, and doesn\\'t substitute one of her own; and so the film is about nothing.<br /><br />This is not the usual complaint of a book-lover that his favorite text has been violated. The merit of the book is something I conceded grudgingly: in reading it I found it a bloody nuisance, and an occasion for kicking the author in the pants and getting him in to finish the job properly. The narrative is supposed to be the work of the half-educated Morvern, but that illusion is constantly dispelled by a dozen different types of literary effect, as if the author were poking at her with his pen; there are inconsistencies of style and tone, as if different sections had been composed at different times; and any conclusions I could reach about Morvern had to remain tentative because it was uncertain which implications the author intended and which he did not: for instance, despite Morvern\\'s own self-characterization as a raver, am I wrong that in the end she remains essentially a working-class Scots girl, and beneath her wrapping of music downloads not so different from those of generations past? In any case, despite my irritation at the author, I couldn\\'t deny that his book stuck with me; and what I couldn\\'t get out of my head was his character\\'s attitude, her angle on the world, which was almost as vivid as a Goya portrait. Morvern is the kind of person who\\'s always encountering situations at once rather comic and rather horrible; occasionally she invites them but more often they land on her, like flies, so that much of her life consists of a kind of gauche but graceful slogging-through, unconsciously practical and unconsciously philosophical--and that doesn\\'t begin to describe it idiosyncratically enough. The complex of incidents and of Morvern\\'s responses to them are the substance of the book, and its achievement, in exposing a cross-section of existence it would be difficult to illuminate otherwise; for all my dislike of the book, I can see this.<br /><br />The Morvern just described is not the Morvern of the movie; or if it is, most of her is kept offscreen. An actress who might have been a good fit for the character, had she been the right age at the right time, is Angharad Rees, from the old TV series \\\\\"Poldark\\\\\". Samantha Morton, then, would seem like good casting: she\\'s rather the same sort of actress, and in one of her earlier movies, \\\\\"Jesus\\' Son\\\\\", she played a girl who with a few adjustments could have been turned into this one. Unfortunately, as the film turned out, she doesn\\'t have the character from the book to play. For one thing, the book is one that, if it is to be dramatized, virtually cries out for monologues by the main character to the audience; without her comments, her perspective, her voice, the story loses most of its meaning. It has lost more of it in that the adaptor has expurgated it of its comic and horrible elements: the most memorable incidents from the book are curtailed before they turn grotty, and so Morvern\\'s responses (whether of amusement or distaste, depending on her mood) are missing too, and the incidents no longer have a reason for being in the story. In short, the filmmaker chose for some reason to turn a brisk, edgy serio-comic novel into a genteel art TV film, and chose as her typical image one of Ms. Morton languishing in a artistically shaded melancholy; as if the outing Morvern signs up for were a tour of the Stations of the Cross. This isn\\'t at all what the book, or the Morvern of the book, was about. For another thing, the Morvern of the movie isn\\'t Scottish (the actress said in an interview she hadn\\'t had time to study up the accent), and she ought to be: it\\'s important that she, her family, and her mates are all from a single place. And finally the film is missing the end of the story: Morvern\\'s spending all she has and coming home to icy darkness: it\\'s winter, the dam has frozen, the power has gone out, and the pub is dark. Minus this, and minus all of the rest, what\\'s left is a failed art film, a dead film, about a subject whose strength lay precisely in her refusal, or native inability, ever to give in to being dead.\"'],\n",

From the time Lindsey Price the videographer shows up until the end the movie was very predictable. I kept on watching to see if it was going anywhere.<br /><br />First we have the widowed young father. Cliché #1 movies/TV always kill off the the mother parent if the child is a girl, or a brood of boys so the single father can get swoon over his dead wife and seem completely out of his element taking care of the children. Starting from from My 3 Sons to 2 1/2 Dads. These movies are usually dramas and comedies are TV shows.<br /><br />Cliché # 2 When a pushy woman has a video camera in her hand she will play a big part in the movie. And will always have solutions or even if that person is a airhead <br /><br />Cliché #3 If the person in peril is a foreigner they have to be of Latino origin. And they must be illegal. Apparently there are no legal Latino\\'s and illegal Europeans, unless if there is a IRA element involved.<br /><br />Cliché #4 The said Latino must be highly educated in his native country. In this case he was a Profesor who made 200 per month. And the said highly educated Latino must now act like he hasn\\'t brain in his head now and lets the air head side kick take over.<br /><br />Cliché #5 The crime the person committed really wasn\\'t a crime but a accident. But because in this case he has lost all of the sense he had when he crossed the boarder he now acts like a blithering idiot and now has put his own daughter in peril by taking her along on a fruitless quest to the border with the idiot side kick.<br /><br />Cliché #6 One never runs over a hoodlum running from a crime , but some poor little cute kid. This is because the parents of the child have to play a big part of the movie, and because the the person who accidentally killed the child can have ridiculous interaction with the parents.<br /><br />Cliché #7 Name me one movie in which one cop is not the angry vet and they get paired up with a rookie. Even if they are homicide detectives who have to be the most experienced cops on a police Force. Sev7n and Copy cat and Law and Order come to mind right away. And the vet even though gruff on the outside has a heart of gold.<br /><br />Cliché #8 Let\\'s go and round up some unemployed Soap Stars. Now I like Lindsey Price. But Susan Haskell IMO can not act her way out of a paper bag and when she use to be on One Life To Live as Marty he swayed from right to left every time she opened her mouth. It use to get me sea sick. She might be anchored on land better now, but she still cannot act.<br /><br />The movie might have been more insightful if it wasn\\'t filled with clichés. I don\\'t think a movie has to be expensive or cerebral to be good. But this was just bad.<br /><br />***SPOILER**** Now I am not going to spoil the ending. Oh heck I will because I feel it will be a disservice to humanity to let a person waste time they will never get back looking at this movie. It involves Cliché #6 and #7. Unless a person has never seen a movie before you had to see what was coming. The father makes even a dumber mistake runs from the cops at the end and gets shot by the angry veteran, who all of a sudden is very upset. You would think she thought the poor guy was innocent all through the movie and she shot him by mistake. When she didn\\'t. Now for the little girl who the dad brought along with him. Guess what happen to her? Times up, she ends up living with the family whose child was killed by her father!! Come on! You all knew that was going to happen, because she is a replacement child!! That is why she did not go and live with the Lindey Price character. <br /><br />This movie was a insult as far as I was concerned. Because there were so many avenues this movie could of explored and went down but it chose to take the cliché ridden one. The 2 stars are for 2 of the stars, the little girl, who I thought was very good and Lindsey Price who character was annoying but she did what she could with it. My advice is take a vice and squeeze your head with it instead of looking at this dreck\"'],\n",

In fact, the weather stays pretty bad throughout this atmospheric thriller, and only lawyer Chamberlain has the answer. But he\\'s too much the European rationalist, I gather, to get in touch with that inner being that only reveals itself through dreams.<br /><br />Darkly original mystery heavy on the metaphysics from director-writer Peter Weir. Already he had proved his skill at flirting with other dimensions in Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975). Here it\\'s the arcane world of the Australian Aborigines that confronts that the tightly ordered world of the predominant whites. Something strange is going on inside the Aborigine community when they kill one of their number for no apparent reason. Yuppie lawyer Chamberlain is supposed to defend them in a white man\\'s court. But the more he looks into things, the more mysterious things get, and the more interested a strange old Aboriginal man gets in him. And then there\\'re those scary dreams that come and go at odd times.<br /><br />Well structured screenplay deepens interest throughout. One reason the movie works is the background normalcy of Chamberlain\\'s wife and little daughters. Audiences can readily identify with them. And when their little world runs into forces beyond the usual framework, the normalcy begins to buckle, and we get the feeling of worlds beginning to collide. Chamberlain underplays throughout, especially during the underground discovery tour where I think he should have shown more growing awareness than he does. After all, it\\'s the picking up of the mask that holds the key (I believe) to the riddle, yet his reaction doesn\\'t really register the revelation. <br /><br />Of course, the notion of nature striking back has a certain resonance now, thirty years later. In the film, the notion is wrapped in a lot of entertaining hocus-pocus, but the subject itself remains a telling one. One way of bringing out a central irony in the movie is the symbolism of the opening scene. A big white SUV barrels past an aboriginal family, leaving them in the historical dust. The terrain looks like an interior tribal reservation of no particular importance to the coastal fleshpots where industry dwells. Yet, it\\'s also a region most likely to survive anything like a destructive last wave. Perhaps there\\'s something about past and future to think about here.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a really good movie that will probably stay with you.\"'],\n",

The acting of Clara Lago is simply amazing for someone so young, and she is one of those special actors who can say say much with facial expressions. Director Imanol Urbibe presents a tight and controlled film with no break in continuity, thereby propelling the plot at a steady pace with just enough suspense to keep one wondering what the nest scene will bring. The screenplay of Angel Garcia Roldan is story telling at its best, which, it seems, if the major purpose for films after all. The plot is unpredictable, yet the events as they unravel are completely logical. Perhaps the best feature of this film if to tell a story of the Spanish Civil War as it affected the people. It was a major event of the 20th century, yet hardly any Americans know of it. In fact, in 40 years of university teaching, I averaged about one student a semester who had even heard of it, much less any who could say anything comprehensive about it--and the overwhelming number of students were merit scholars, all of which speaks to the enormous amount of censorship in American education. So, in one way, this film is a good way to begin a study of that event, keeping in mind that when one thread is pulled a great deal of history is unraveled. The appreciation of this film is, therefore, in direct relation to the amount of one\\'s knowledge. To view this film as another coming of age movie is the miss the movie completely. The Left Elbow Index considers seven aspects of film-- acting, production sets, character development, plot, dialogue, film continuity, and artistry--on a scale for 10 for very good, 5 for average, and 1 for needs help.

       "  '\"Time for a rant, eh: I thought Spirit was a great movie to watch. However, there were a few things that stop me from rating it higher than a 6 or 7 (I\\'m being a little bit generous with the 7).<br /><br />Point #1: Matt Damon aggravates me. I was thinking, \\'what a dicky voice they got for the main character,\\' when I first heard him narrate - and then I realized it is Matt Damon. The man bugs me so very bad - his performance in \\\\\"The Departed\\\\\" was terrible and ruined the movie for me (before the movie got a chance to ruin itself, but that\\'s another story for some other time), as it almost did \\\\\"Spirit\\\\\". I was able to get past this fact because of how little narration there actually was... thankfully.<br /><br />Point #2: Brian Adams sucks... The whole score was terrible... The songs were unoriginal, generic, and poorly executed; not once did I find the music to fit; and the lyrics were terrible. Every time one of the lame songs came on, I was turned off. I almost thought I\\'d start hearing some patriotic propaganda slipped into the super-American freedom style lyrics (I couldn\\'t help but be reminded of those terrible patriotic songs that played on the radio constantly after 9/11). In light of the native American aspects of the film, they should have gone with fitting music using right instruments, not petty radio-hit, teen-bop, 14-year-old-girl crap. I thought I was back in junior high school. I can\\'t believe no better could have been done--I refuse to. Had it not have been for this, I\\'d rank the film up more with Disney, which knows a thing or two about originality (ok, don\\'t bother saying what I know some of you are probably thinking ;). Too bad, it\\'s a shame they couldn\\'t have hired better musicians.<br /><br />I liked the art and animation, except for some things here and there... like sometimes the angles appear too sharp on the face and the lines too thick or dark on the body (thick/dark lines mainly near the end). There were often times when I thought they _tried too hard_ on the emotion and facial expressions and failed at drawing any real emotion. But there were also times when the emotion ran thick. Anyhow, many scenes were lazy and the layers were apparent.<br /><br />OK, I\\'m falling asleep here so I\\'ll sum it up before I start making less sense...<br /><br />Nice try on an epic film... it turned out mediocre though.

       "  '\"In the tradition of G-Men, The House On 92nd Street, The Street With No Name, now comes The FBI Story one of those carefully supervised films that showed the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the best possible light. While it\\'s 48 year director J. Edgar Hoover was alive, it would be showed in no other kind of light.<br /><br />The book by Don Whitehead that this film is based on is a straight forward history of the bureau from it\\'s founding in 1907 until roughly the time the film The FBI Story came out. It\\'s important sometimes to remember there WAS an FBI before J. Edgar Hoover headed it. Some of that time is covered in the film as well.<br /><br />But Warner Brothers was not making a documentary so to give the FBI flesh and blood the fictional character of John \\'Chip\\' Hardesty was created. Hardesty as played by James Stewart is a career FBI man who graduated law school and rather than go in practice took a job with the bureau in the early twenties.<br /><br />In real life the Bureau was headed by William J. Burns of the Burns Private Detective Agency. It was in fact a grossly political operation then as is showed in the film. Burns was on the periphery of the scandals of the Harding administration. When Hoover was appointed in 1924 to bring professional law enforcement techniques and rigorous standards of competence in, he did just that. <br /><br />Through the Hardesty family which is Stewart and wife Vera Miles we see the history of the FBI unfold. In addition we see a lot of their personal family history which is completely integrated into the FBI\\'s story itself. Stewart and Miles are most assuredly an all American couple. We follow the FBI through some of the cases Stewart is involved with, arresting Ku Klux Klan members, a plot to murder oil rich Indians, bringing down the notorious criminals of the thirties, their involvement with apprehending Nazi sympathizers in World War II and against Communist espionage in the Cold War.<br /><br />There is a kind of prologue portion where Stewart tells a class at the FBI Academy before going into the history of the bureau as it intertwines with his own. That involves a bomb placed on an airline by a son who purchased a lot of life insurance on his mother before the flight. Nick Adams will give you the creeps as the perpetrator and the story is sadly relevant today.<br /><br />Of course if The FBI Story were written and produced today it would reflect something different and not so all American. Still the FBI does have a story to tell and it is by no means a negative one.<br /><br />The FBI Story is not one of Jimmy Stewart\\'s best films, but it\\'s the first one I ever saw with my favorite actor in it so it has a special fondness for me. If the whole FBI were made up Jimmy Stewarts, I\\'d feel a lot better about it. There\\'s also a good performance by Murray Hamilton as his friend and fellow agent who is killed in a shootout with Baby Face Nelson.<br /><br />Vera Miles didn\\'t just marry Stewart, she in fact married the FBI as the film demonstrates. It\\'s dated mostly, but still has a good and interesting story to tell.\"'],\n",

There were great expectations for this back in 1982 \\x96 a script co-written by The Wild Bunch\\'s Walon Green, Jack Nicholson in the days when he could still act without semaphore and a great supporting cast (Harvey Keitel, Warren Oates, Valerie Perrine), Tony Richardson directing (although he was pretty much a spent force by then) \\x96 but now it doesn\\'t even turn up on TV. The material certainly offers a rich seam of possibilities for comment on the 80s American Dreams of capitalism and conspicuous consumption, with Nicholson\\'s border patrolman turning a blind eye to the odd drug deal or bit of people trafficking to finance his wife\\'s relentless materialism, until he rediscovers his conscience when he finds out his partners are also in the baby selling business. Unfortunately, he never really gets his hands dirty, barely even turning a blind eye before his decency rises to the surface. The film feels always watered down as if too many rewrites and too many committees have left it neutered and, sadly, the recent DVD release is a missed opportunity to restore the original, nihilistic ending where Nicholson goes over the edge and firebombs the border patrol station that was cut after preview audiences found it too downbeat but which still featured prominently in the film\\'s trailers.<br /><br />While that probably wasn\\'t too convincing considering how low-key Nicholson\\'s crisis of conscience is in the film, it had to be better than the crude reshot climax where the film abandons logic and even basic rules of continuity: at one point he\\'s holding characters at gunpoint, then he\\'s somewhere else and they\\'re free trying to kill him, one character goes from injured at his house to hopping around like a gazelle on the banks of the Rio Grande while Valerie Perrine\\'s character gets dumber on an exponential level. The villains of the piece are disposed of with absurd ease (and one impressive car stunt) in time for a clumsily edited happy ending and you start wondering if you somehow found yourself watching another film entirely. What makes it all the more clumsy is that the rest of the film is so flat and underwhelming that the sudden lurch into melodrama is all the more jarring. Unfortunately Ry Cooder\\'s beautiful title song, Across the Borderline, says it all much more economically. But if you want to know the film\\'s real crime, it\\'s completely wasting the great Warren Oates in a nothing bit part. When even he can\\'t make an impression, you know something\\'s really wrong.

       "  '\"In what could have been seen as a coup towards the sexual \\\\\"revolution\\\\\" (purposefully I use quotations for that word), Jean Eustache wrote and directed The Mother and the Whore as a poetic, damning critique of those who can\\'t seem to get enough love. If there is a message to this film- and I\\'d hope that the message would come only after the fact of what else this Ben-Hur length feature has to offer- it\\'s that in order to love, honestly, there has to be some level of happiness, of real truth. Is it possible to have two lovers? Some can try, but what is the outcome if no one can really have what they really want, or feel they can even express to say what they want? <br /><br />What is the truth in the relationships that Alexandre (Jean-Pierre Leaud) has with the women around him? He\\'s a twenty-something pseudo-intellectual, not with any seeming job and he lives off of a woman, Marie (Bernadette Lafont) slightly older than him and is usually, if not always, his lover, his last possible love-of-his-life left him, and then right away he picks up a woman he sees on the street, Veronika (Françoise Lebrun), who perhaps reminds him of her. Soon what unfolds is the most subtly torrid love triangle ever put on film, where the psychological strings are pulled with the cruelest words and the slightest of gestures. At first we think it might be all about what will happen to Alexandre, but we\\'re mistaken. The women are so essential to this question of love and sex that they have to be around, talking on and on, for something to sink in.<br /><br />We\\'re told that part of the sexual revolution, in theory if not entirely in practice (perhaps it was, I can\\'t say having not been alive in the period to see it first-hand), was that freedom led to a lack of inhibitions. But Eustache\\'s point, if not entirely message, is that it\\'s practically impossible to have it both ways: you can\\'t have people love you and expect to get the satisfaction of ultimate companionship that arrives with \\\\\"f***ing\\\\\", as the characters refer over and over again. <br /><br />The Mother and the Whore\\'s strengths as far as having the theme is expressing this dread beneath the promiscuity, the lack of monogamy, while also stimulating the intellect in the talkiest talk you\\'ve ever seen in a movie. At the same time we see a character like Alexandre, who probably loves to hear himself talk whether it\\'s about some movie he saw or something bad from his past, Eustache makes it so that the film itself isn\\'t pretentious- though it could appear to be- but that it\\'s about pretentiousness, what lies beneath those who are covering up for their internal flaws, what they need to use when they\\'re ultimately alone in the morning. <br /><br />If you thought films like Before Sunrise/Sunset were talky relationship flicks, you haven\\'t met this. But as Eustache revels in the dialogs these characters have, sometimes trivial, or \\'deep\\', or sexual, or frank, or occasionally extremely (or in a subdued manner) emotional, it\\'s never, ever uninteresting or boring. On the contrary, for those who can\\'t get enough of a *good* talky film, it\\'s exceptional. While his style doesn\\'t call out to the audaciousness that came with his forerunners in the nouvelle vague a dozen years beforehand, Eustache\\'s new-wave touch is with the characters, and then reverberating on them.<br /><br />This is realism with a spike of attitude, with things at time scathing and sarcastic, crude and without shame in expression. All three of the actors are so glued to their characters that we can\\'t ever perceive them as \\'faking\\' an emotion or going at all into melodrama. It\\'s almost TOO good in naturalistic/realism terms, but for Eustache\\'s material there is no other way around it. Luckily Leaud delivers the crowning chip of his career of the period, and both ladies, particularly Labrun as the \\\\\"whore\\\\\" Veronika (a claim she staggeringly refutes in the film\\'s climax of sorts in one unbroken shot). And, as another touch, every so often, the director will dip into a quiet moment of thought, of a character sitting by themselves, listening to a record, and in contemplation or quiet agony. This is probably the biggest influence on Jim Jarmusch, who dedicated his film Broken Flowers to Eustache and has one scene in particular that is lifted completely (and lovingly) in approach from the late Parisian.<br /><br />Sad to say, before I saw Broken Flowers, I never heard of Eustache or this film, and procuring it has become quite a challenge (not available on US DVD, and on VHS so rare it took many months of tracking at various libraries). Not a minute of that time was wasted; the Mother and the Whore is truly beautiful work, one of the best of French relationship dramas, maybe even just one of the most staggeringly lucid I\\'ve seen from the country in general. It\\'s complex, it\\'s sweet, it\\'s cold, it\\'s absorbing, and it\\'s very long, perhaps too long. It\\'s also satisfying on the kind of level that I\\'d compare to Scenes from a Marriage; true revelations about the human condition continue to arise 35 years after each film\\'s release.\"'],\n",

Sometimes we get absurd and compare guys like MacGyver and The Terminator or Rambo and Matrix. But now it seems that we discuss guys like Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee and Jet Li. It is a pointless comparison seeing that Lee is dead, but it is a fun one. And if you go by what we have seen from Jet Li in Lethal 4 and Black Mask, you have to at least say that he would match up well against Chan. In this film he comes across as a martial arts God.<br /><br />Black Mask is about a man that was created along with many other men, to be supreme fighting machines. Their only purpose is to win wars that other people lose. They are invincible in some ways. Now that is the premise for the film, but what that does is sets up all the amazingly choreographed fight scenes.<br /><br />Jet Li is a marvel. He can do things with and to his body that no human being should be able to do. And that is what makes watching him so fun.<br /><br />Besides the martial arts in the film, Black Mask is strong with humour and that is due to the chemistry that Jet has with his co-star, the police officer. They are great together. But to be honest. if anyone is reading this review, they want to know if the film is kick ass in the action department. And the answer to that is a resounding YES!!! Lots and lots of gory mindless action. You will love this film.\"'],\n",

What would you expect from a group of folks whose only experience has been in the production of low budget, locally produced (Valley Forge PA) Christian Shorts. Let me tell those overly critical reviewers that this film never took itself all that serious. That fact should be evident from the mismatched theme music complete with silly lyrics played over the opening credits. For what it was meant to be, this film is excellent. I have seen a few of the recent ultra low budget attempts, Blair Witch Project was one of them, that have absolutely no entertainment value or intelligent thought behind their plot. BWP was pure excrement. The Blob, on the other hand, was well thought out, well scripted, and thoroughly entertaining. The scene where the old man comes across the meteorite and pokes the mass contained within with a stick was excellently done and genuinely creepy. The scene in the doctor\\'s office with the Blob slowly moving under the blanket on the gurney while it consumed the old man was a cinematic horror masterpiece. Bottom line is, I love this movie.

A dark comedy satirizing the military and corporations alike. It was often difficult to figure out what exactly was going on. I kept waiting for things to make sense. There\\'s no reason or method to the madness.<br /><br />It\\'s considered by Cusack to be the \\\\\"spiritual successor\\\\\" to Grosse Point Blank. I.e., War is more or less a knock-off. We again see Cusack as an assassin protecting *spoiler* the person he\\'s supposed to kill as he grips with his conscience. To be fair, John Cusack looks kind of credible taking out half a dozen guys with relative ease. The brief fights look good. The rest of the film does not. It\\'s all quirky often bordering on bizarre. War Inc\\'s not funny enough to be a parody, and too buoyant for anyone to even think about whatever the film\\'s message might be, which I suppose might be the heartless ways that corporations, like war factions compete and scheme without a drop of consideration given to how they affect average citizens. Interesting, but the satire just doesn\\'t work because it\\'s not funny and at its heart the film has no heart. We\\'re supposed to give a damn about how war affects Cusack\\'s shell of a character rather than the millions of lives torn apart by war.<br /><br />John Cusack gives a decent performance.

There really isn\\'t a lot of chemistry between them. Hilary Duff tries a Russian accent and doesn\\'t make a fool of herself. Joan Cusack just screams and whines and wigs out. Blech.

       "  '\"This film has got to be ranked as one of the most disturbing and arresting films in years. It is one of the few films, perhaps the only one, that actually gave me shivers: not even Pasolini´s Sálo, to which this film bears comparison, affected me like that. I saw echoes in the film from filmmakers like Pasolini, Fassbinder and others. I had to ask myself, what was it about the film that made me feel like I did? I think the answer would be that I was watching a horror film, but one that defies or even reverses the conventions of said genre. Typically, in a horror film, horrible and frightening things will happen, but on the margins of civilized society: abandoned houses, deserted hotels, castles, churchyards, morgues etc. This handling of the subject in horror is, I think, a sort of defence mechanism, a principle of darkness and opacity functioning as a sort of projective space for the desires and fears of the viewer. So, from this perspective, Hundstage is not a horror film; it takes place in a perfectly normal society, and so doesn´t dabble in the histrionics of the horror film. But what you see is the displacement of certain key thematics from the horror genre, especially concerning the body and its violation, the stages of fright and torture it can be put through. What Seidl does is to use the settings of an everyday, middle class society as a stage on which is relayed a repetitious play of sexual aggression, loneliness, lack and violation of intimacy and integrity: precisely the themes you would find in horror, but subjected to a principle of light and transparency from which there is no escape. It is precisely within this displacement that the power of Seidl´s film resides. Hundstage deals with these matters as a function of the everyday, displays them in quotidian repetition, rather than as sites of extremity and catharsis - a move you would encounter in said horror genre. One important point of reference here is Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Fassbinder also had a way of blending the political with the personal in his films, a tactics of the melodrama that allowed him to deal in a serious and even moral way with political issues like racism, domination, desire, questions concerning ownership, sexual property and control, fascism and capitalism etc. Seidl´s tactic of making the mechanisms of everyday society the subject of his film puts him in close proximity with Fassbinder; like this German ally, he has a sort of political vision of society that he feels it is his responsibility to put forward in his films. During a seminar at the Gothenburg Film Festival this year, at which Seidl was a guest, he was asked why he would have so many instances of violated, subjugated women in Hundstage, but no instances of a woman fighting back, liberating herself. Seidl replied that some may view it as immoral to show violence against women, but that he himself felt it would be immoral not to show it. An artistic statement as good as any, I think. Thank you.\"'],\n",

Now it still deserves inclusion to honor a great director and a great cinematic conservator of Spanish culture, but he has done a lot like this before, and though we can applaud the riches he has given us, we have to pick and choose favorites and high points among similar films which include Blood Wedding (1981), Carmen (1983), El Amore Brujo (1986), Sevillanas (1992), Salomé (2002) and Tango (1998). I would choose Saura\\'s 1995 Flamenco as his most unique and potent cultural document, next to which Iberia pales.<br /><br />Iberia is conceived as a series of interpretations of the music of Isaac Manuel Francisco Albéniz (1860-1909) and in particular his \\\\\"Iberia\\\\\" suite for piano. Isaac Albéniz was a great contributor to the externalization of Spanish musical culture -- its re-formatting for a non-Spanish audience. He moved to France in his early thirties and was influenced by French composers. His \\\\\"Iberia\\\\\" suite is an imaginative synthesis of Spanish folk music with the styles of Liszt, Dukas and d\\'Indy. He traveled around performing his compositions, which are a kind of beautiful standardization of Spanish rhythms and melodies, not as homogenized as Ravel\\'s Bolero but moving in that direction. Naturally, the Spanish have repossessed Albéniz, and in Iberia, the performers reinterpret his compositions in terms of various more ethnic and regional dances and styles. But the source is a tamed and diluted form of Spanish musical and dance culture compared to the echt Spanishness of pure flamenco. Flamenco, coming out of the region of Andalusia, is a deeply felt amalgam of gitane, Hispano-Arabic, and Jewish cultures. Iberia simply is the peninsula comprising Spain, Portugal, Andorra and Gibraltar; the very concept is more diluted. <br /><br />Saura\\'s Flamenco is an unstoppably intense ethnic mix of music, singing, dancing and that peacock manner of noble preening that is the essence of Spanish style, the way a man and a woman carries himself or herself with pride verging on arrogance and elegance and panache -- even bullfights and the moves of the torero are full of it -- in a series of electric sequences without introduction or conclusion; they just are. Saura always emphasized the staginess of his collaborations with choreographer Antonio Gades and other artists. In his 1995 Flamenco he dropped any pretense of a story and simply has singers, musicians, and dancers move on and off a big sound stage with nice lighting and screens, flats, and mirrors arranged by cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, another of the Spanish filmmaker\\'s important collaborators. The beginnings and endings of sequences in Flamenco are often rough, but atmospheric, marked only by the rumble and rustle of shuffling feet and a mixture of voices. Sometimes the film keeps feeding when a performance is over and you see the dancer bend over, sigh, or laugh; or somebody just unexpectedly says something. In Flamenco more than any of Saura\\'s other musical films it\\'s the rapt, intense interaction of singers and dancers and rhythmically clapping participant observers shouting impulsive olé\\'s that is the \\\\\"story\\\\\" and creates the magic. Because Saura has truly made magic, and perhaps best so when he dropped any sort of conventional story.<br /><br />Iberia is in a similar style to some of Saura\\'s purest musical films: no narration, no dialogue, only brief titles to indicate the type of song or the region, beginning with a pianist playing Albeniz\\'s music and gradually moving to a series of dance sequences and a little singing. In flamenco music, the fundamental element is the unaccompanied voice, and that voice is the most unmistakable and unique contribution to world music. It relates to other songs in other ethnicities, but nothing quite equals its raw raucous unique ugly-beautiful cry that defies you to do anything but listen to it with the closest attention. Then comes the clapping and the foot stomping, and then the dancing, combined with the other elements. There is only one flamenco song in Iberia. If you love Saura\\'s Flamenco, you\\'ll want to see Iberia, but you\\'ll be a bit disappointed. The style is there; some of the great voices and dancing and music are there. But Iberia\\'s source and conception doom it to a lesser degree of power and make it a less rich and intense cultural experience.\"'],\n",

The whole first act violently juxtaposes from scene to scene the normal family life of the main kid/hero, with the spirit world and the evil than is ensuing therein. And while the ending does have a bit of an ambiguous aspect that are common of Miike\\'s work, the layers of meaning and metaphor, particularly the anti-war / anti-revenge message of human folly, is pretty damn poignant. As manic and imaginatively fun as other great Miike films, only instead of over the top torture and gore, he gives us an endless amount of monsters and yokai from Japanese folk-lore creatively conceived via CG and puppetry wrapped into an imaginative multi-faceted adventure.

       "  '\"Running only seventy-two minutes, this small, overlooked 2006 dramedy is really just a two-character sketch piece but one that works very well within its limitations. Taking place almost entirely in various, non-descript spots in southern Los Angeles, the story itself is inconsequential, but like Sofia Coppola\\'s \\\\\"Lost in Translation\\\\\", the film is far more about two strangers who meet unexpectedly, find a common bond and go back to their lives enlightened for the momentous encounter. It also helps considerably that Morgan Freeman and Paz Vega are playing the characters. Finally freed of the wise sages and authority figures beyond reproach that have become his big-screen specialty, Freeman seems comparatively liberated as a somewhat self-indulgent movie star. His character is driven to a low-rent grocery store in Carson, where he will be able to research a role he is considering in an indie film.<br /><br />Out of work for a few years, he is embarrassed when he sees DVDs of his films in the bargain bin, but his ego is such that he does not lack the temerity to watch and even mimic the enervated store staff. Of particular fascination to him is Scarlet, an embittered worker from Spain and relegated to the express line where she is the unsung model of efficiency. She has an interview for a secretarial job at a construction company, but her deep-seeded insecurity seems to defeat her chances already. Still looking like Penelope Cruz\\'s Amazonian sister, the beautiful Vega (one of the few redeemable aspects of James L. Brooks\\' execrable \\\\\"Spanglish\\\\\") brings a stinging edge and realistic vulnerability to Scarlet. She and Freeman interplay very well throughout the story, which includes stops not only at the grocery store but also at Target, Arby\\'s and a full-service carwash. Nothing earth-shattering happens except to show how two people realize the resonating transience of chance encounters.<br /><br />Silberling keeps the proceedings simple, but the production also reflects expert craftsmanship in Phedon Papamichael\\'s vibrant cinematography (he lensed Alexander Payne\\'s \\\\\"Sideways\\\\\") and the infectious score by Brazilian composer Antonio Pinto (\\\\\"City of God\\\\\"). There are fast cameos by Bobby Cannavale (as Scarlet\\'s soon-to-be-ex-husband) and as themselves, Danny DeVito and Rhea Perlman, as well as a funny bits with Jonah Hill (\\\\\"Knocked Up\\\\\") as the clueless driver and Jim Parsons (the \\\\\"knight\\\\\" in \\\\\"Garden State\\\\\") as a worshipful receptionist. The 2007 DVD is overstuffed with extras, including a making-of documentary, \\\\\"15 Days or Less\\\\\", aimed at film students and running a marathon 103 minutes; six extended scenes; a light-hearted but insightful three-way conversation between Silberling, Freeman and Vega in the middle of Target; and a couple of snippets that specifically advertise the DVD.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"To bad for this fine film that it had to be released the same year as Braveheart. Though it is a very different kind of film, the conflict between Scottish commoners and English nobility is front and center here as well. Roughly 400 years had passed between the time Braveheart took place and Rob Roy was set, but some things never seemed to change. Scottland is still run by English nobles, and the highlanders never can seem to catch a break when dealing with them. Rob Roy is handsomely done, but not the grand epic that Braveheart was. There are no large-scale battles, and the conflict here is more between individuals. And helpfully so not all Englishmen are portrayed as evil this time. Rob Roy is simply a film about those with honor, and those who are truly evil.<br /><br />Liam Neeson plays the title character Rob Roy MacGregor. He is the leader of the MacGregor clan and his basic function is to tend to and protect the cattle of the local nobleman of record known as the Marquis of Montrose (John Hurt). Things look pretty rough for the MacGregor clan as winter is approaching, and there seems to be a lack of food for everyone. Rob Roy puts together a plan to borrow 1000 pounds from the Marquis and purchase some cattle of his own. He would then sell them off for a higher price and use the money to improve the general well-being of his community. Sounds fair enough, doesn\\'t it? Problems arise when two cronies of the Marquis steal the money for themselves. One of them, known as Archibald Cunningham, is perhaps the most evil character ever put on film. Played wonderfully by Tim Roth, this man is a penniless would-be noble who has been sent to live with the Marquis by his mother. This man is disgustingly effeminate, rude, heartless, and very dangerous with a sword. He fathers a child with a hand maiden and refuses to own up to the responsibility. He rapes Macgregor\\'s wife and burns him out of his home. This guy is truly as rotten as movie characters come. Along with another crony of the Marquis (Brian Cox) Cunningham steals the money and uses it to settle his own debts. Though it is painfully obvious to most people what happened, the Marquis still holds MacGregor to the debt. This sets up conflict that will take many lives and challenge the strengths of a man simply fighting to hold on to his dignity.<br /><br />Spoilers ahead!!!!!<br /><br />Luckily for the MacGregor\\'s, a Duke who is no friend to the Marquis sets up a final duel between Rob Roy and Cunningham to resolve the conflict one and for all. This sword fight has been considered by many to be one of the best ever filmed. Cunningham is thought by many to be a sure winner with his speed and grace. And for most of the fight, it looks like these attributes will win out. Just when it looks like Rob Roy is finished, he turns the tables in a shockingly grotesque manner. The first time you see what happens, you will probably be as shocked as Cunningham! Rob Roy is beautifully filmed, wonderfully acted, and perfectly paced. The score is quite memorable, too. The casting choices seem to have worked out as Jessica Lange, who might seem to be out of her element, actually turns in one of the strongest performances as Mary MacGregor. The film is violent, but there isn\\'t too much gore. It is a lusty picture full of deviant behavior, however. The nobility are largely played as being amoral and sleazy. The film has no obvious flaws, thus it gets 10 of 10 stars.<br /><br />The Hound.\"'],\n",

This movie will also tell you why Indian movie-goers are astute buyers.<br /><br />Amitabh was at the peak of his domination of Bollywood when his one-time godfather Prakash Mehra decided to use his image yet again. Prakash has the habit of picking themes and building stories out of it, adding liberal doses of Bollywood sensibilities and clichés to it. Zanzeer saw the making of Angry Young Man. Lawaris was about being a bastard and Namak Halal was about the master-servant loyalties. <br /><br />But then, the theme was limited to move the screenplay through the regulation three hours of song, dance and drama. What comprised of the movie is a caricature of a Haryanavi who goes to Mumbai and turns into a regulation hero. Amitabh\\'s vocal skills and diction saw this movie earn its big bucks, thanks to his flawless stock Haryanvi accent. To me, this alone is the biggest pull in the movie. The rest all is typical Bollywood screen writing.<br /><br />Amitabh, by now, had to have some typical comedy scenes in each of his movies. Thanks to Manmohan Desai. This movie had a good dose of them. The shoe caper in the party, the monologue over Vijay Merchant and Vijay Hazare\\'s considerations, The mosquito challenge in the boardroom and the usual drunkard scene that by now has become a standard Amitabh fare.<br /><br />Shashi Kapoor added an extra mile to the movie with his moody, finicky character (Remember him asking Ranjeet to \\\\\"Shaaadaaaap\\\\\" after the poisoned cake incident\\\\\"). His was the all important role of the master while Amitabh was his loyal servant. But Prakash Mehra knew the Indian mind...and so Shashi had to carry along his act with the rest of the movie. It was one character that could have been more developed to make a serious movie. But this is a caper, remember? And as long as it stayed that way, the people came and saw Amitabh wearing a new hat and went back home happy. The end is always predictable, and the good guys get the gal and the bad ones go to the gaol, the age-old theme of loyalty is once again emphasized and all is well that ends well.<br /><br />So what is it that makes this movie a near classic? Amitabh Bacchan as the Haryanvi. Prakash Mehra created yet another icon in the name of a story. Chuck the story, the characters and the plot. My marks are for Amitabh alone.\"'],\n",

Without the music, the story is only half told. Nancy Wilson created an emotional, yet eclectic, score for the film which could not be more suitable for such a dream-like theme (although never released, I was able to get my hands on the original score for about $60. If you look hard, you may be able to find a copy yourself). Crowe\\'s other musical selections, such as The Beach Boys, Josh Rouse, Spiritualized, Sigur Ros, the Monkees, etcetera etcetera, are also perfect fits for the film (Crowe has an ear for great music).<br /><br />More importantly, the emotional themes in this film (i.e. love, sadness, regret) are very powerful, and are amplified tenfold by the visual and musical experience, as well as the ingenious dialogue; I admit, the elevator scene brings tears to my eyes time and time again.<br /><br />The best part of this film however (as if it could get any better) is that it is so intelligently crafted such that each time you see the film, you will catch something new--so watch closely, and be prepared to think!

       "  '\"I last read a Nancy Drew book about 20 years ago, so much of my memory of the fictional character is probably faulty. From what I gathered, the books were introduced to me at an era when teenage sleuths were popular to children growing up at the time (for my case, the 80s and early 90s), with Hardy Boys, Famous Five, and of course, \\\\\"Carolyn Keene\\\\\"\\'s Nancy Drew amongst the more famous ones. I still remember those hardcover books with very dated cover illustrations, usually quite heavy (for a kid) to lug around, and the thickness of the book perhaps attributed to the fact that the words are printed in large fonts.<br /><br />Well, the character has been given some updates along the way, as I recall my sister\\'s subsequent Nancy Drew books becoming less thick, of softcover, with updated and a more chic Nancy illustrated on the cover. I can\\'t remember if those stories were the same as the old hardcover ones, but I guess these books, being ghostwritten, have their fair share of updating itself for the times.<br /><br />In this Warner Brothers release of Nancy Drew, the character no doubt gets its update to suit the times, but somehow the writers Andrew Fleming and Tiffany Paulsen maintained her 50s- ish small town sensibilities, thereby retaining some charm and flavour that erm, folks like me, would appreciate. Her fashion sense, her prim and properness, even some quirky little behaviour traits that makes her, well, Nancy Drew.<br /><br />Her family background remains more or less the same, living with her single parent father Carson Drew (Tate Donovan), who is moving his daughter and himself to the big city for a better job opportunity, and to wean his daughter off sleuthing in the town of River Heights. Mom is but a distant memory, and the housemaid makes a cameo. But what made Nancy Drew work, is the casting of Emma Roberts in the lead role. Niece of her famous aunt Julia, she too possess that sprightly demeanour, that unmistakable red hair and that megawatt smile. Her Nancy Drew, while in the beginning does seem to rub you the wrong way, actually will grow on you. And in almost what I thought could be a discarded scene from Pretty Woman, it had the characters walk into a classy shop with almost opposite reactions.<br /><br />While Dad Carson Drew tries hard to bring Nancy out of her sleuthing environment and to assimilate into normal teenage life, trust Nancy to find themselves living in a house whose owner, a Hollywood type has been, was found murdered under suspicious circumstances. Mystery solving is her comfort food when she finds herself an outcast of the local fraternity, and not before long we\\'re whisked off along with her on her big screen adventure.<br /><br />There\\'s nothing too Black Dahlia about the crime and mystery, and instead it\\'s a pretty straightforward piece for Nancy to solve, in between befriending Corky (Josh Flitter) a chubby friend from school, and pacifying jealous boyfriend Ned (Max Thieriot), while hiding the truth of her extra curriculum activities from her dad. The story\\'s laced with cheesy fun and an oldie sentimentality which charms, and together, it becomes somewhat scooby-doo like. With minimal violence and no big bag gunfights or explosions, this is seriously a genre which is labelled clearly with \\\\\"chick flick\\\\\" alert.<br /><br />I guess the movie will generate a new generation of fans, rekindle the memories of old ones, and probably, just probably, might spark a new fashion trend of sporting penny loafers.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"Oh Dear Lord, How on Earth was any part of this film ever approved by anyone? It reeks of cheese from start to finish, but it\\'s not even good cheese. It\\'s the scummiest, moldiest, most tasteless cheese there is, and I cannot believe there is anyone out there who actually, truly enjoyed it. Yes, if you saw it with a load of drunk/stoned buddies then some bits might be funny in a sad kind of way, but for the rest of the audience the only entertaining parts are when said group of buddies are throwing popcorn and abusive insults at each other and the screen. I watched it with an up-for-a-few-laughs guy, having had a few beers in preparation to chuckle away at the film\\'s expected crapness. We got the crapness (plenty of it), but not the chuckles. It doesn\\'t even qualify as a so-bad-it\\'s-good movie. It\\'s just plain bad. Very, very bad. Here\\'s why (look away if you\\'re spoilerphobic): The movie starts out with a guy beating another guy to death. OK, I was a few minutes late in so not sure why this was, but I think I grasped the \\'this guy is a bit of a badass who you don\\'t want to mess with\\' message behind the ingenious scene. Oh, and a guy witnesses it. So, we already have our ultra-evil bad guy, and wussy but cute (apparently) good guy. Cue Hero. Big Sam steps on the scene in the usual fashion, saving good guy in the usual inane way that only poor action films can accomplish, i.e. Hero is immune to bullets, everyone else falls over rather clumsily. Cue first plot hole. How the bloody hell did Sammy know where this guy was, or that he\\'d watched the murder. Perhaps this, and the answers to all my plot-hole related questions, was explained in the 2 minutes before I got into the cinema, but I doubt it. In fact, I\\'m going to stop poking holes in the plot right here, lest I turn the movie into something resembling swiss cheese (which we all know is good cheese). So, the \\'plot\\' (a very generous word to use). Good guy must get to LA, evil guy would rather he didn\\'t, Hero Sam stands between the two. Cue scenery for the next vomit-inducing hour - the passenger plane. As I said, no more poking at plot holes, I\\'ll just leave it there. Passenger plane. Next, the vital ingredient up until now missing from this gem of a movie, and what makes it everything it is - Snakes. Yay! Oh, pause. First we have the introduction to all the obligatory characters that a lame movie must have. Hot, horny couple (see if you can guess how they die), dead-before-any-snakes-even-appear British guy (those pesky Brits, eh?), cute kids, and Jo Brand. For all you Americans that\\'s an English comic famous for her size and unattractiveness. Now that we\\'ve met the cast, let\\'s watch all of them die (except of course the cute kids). Don\\'t expect anything original, it\\'s just snake bites on various and ever-increasingly hilarious (really not) parts of the body. Use your imagination, since the film-makers obviously didn\\'t use theirs.<br /><br />So, that\\'s most of the film wrapped up, so now for the best bit, the ending. As expected, everything is just so happy as the plane lands that everyone in sight starts sucking face. Yep, Ice-cool Sammy included. But wait, we\\'re not all off the plane yet! The last guy to get off is good guy, but just as he does he gets bitten by a (you guessed it) snake (of all things). Clearly this one had been hiding in Mr. Jackson\\'s hair the whole time, since it somehow managed to resist the air pressure trick that the good old hero had employed a few minutes earlier, despite the 200ft constrictor (the one that ate that pesky British bugger) being unable to. So, Sam shoots him and the snake in one fell swoop. At this point I prayed that the movie was about to make a much-needed U-turn and reveal that all along the hero was actually a traitor of some sort. But no. In a kind of icing on the cake way (but with stale cheese, remember), it is revealed that the climax of the film was involving a bullet proof vest. How anyone can think that an audience 10 years ago, let alone in 2006 would be impressed by their ingenuity is beyond me, but it did well in summing up the film.<br /><br />Actually, we\\'re not quite done yet. After everyone has sucked face (Uncle Sam with leading actress, good guy with Tiffany, token Black guy with token White girl, and the hot couple in a heart warming bout of necrophilia), it\\'s time for good guy and hero to get it on....In Bali!!! Nope, it wasn\\'t at all exciting, the exclamation marks were just there to represent my utter joy at seeing the credits roll. Yes, the final shot of the film is a celebratory surfing trip to convey the message that a bit of male bonding has occurred, and a chance for any morons that actually enjoyed the movie to whoop a few times. That\\'s it. This is the first time I\\'ve ever posted a movie review, but I felt so strongly that somebody must speak out against this scourge of cinematography. If you like planes, snakes, Samuel L.Jackson, air hostesses, bad guys, surfing, dogs in bags or English people, then please, please don\\'t see this movie.

       "  '\"I went into Deathtrap expecting a well orchestrated and intriguing thriller; and while that\\'s something like what this film is; I also can\\'t help but think that it\\'s just a poor man\\'s Sleuth. The classic 1972 film is obviously an inspiration for this film; not particularly in terms of the plot, but certainly it\\'s the case with the execution. The casting of Michael Caine in the central role just confirms it. The film is based on a play by Ira Levin (who previously wrote Rosemary\\'s Baby and The Stepford Wives) and focuses on Sidney Bruhl; a playwright whose best days are behind him. After his latest play bombs, Sidney finds himself at a low; and this is not helped when a play named Deathtrap; written by an amateur he taught, arrives on his doorstep. Deathtrap is a guaranteed commercial success, and Sidney soon begins hatching a plot of his own; which involves inviting round the amateur scribe, killing him, and then passing Deathtrap off as his own work.<br /><br />Despite all of its clever twists and turns; Deathtrap falls down on one primary element, and that\\'s the characters. The film fails to provide a single likable character, and it\\'s very hard to care about the story when you\\'re not rooting for any of the players. This is not helped by the acting. Michael Caine puts in a good and entertaining performance as you would expect, but nobody else does themselves proud. Christopher Reeve is awkward in his role, while Dyan Cannon somehow manages to make the only possibly likable character detestable with a frankly irritating performance. It\\'s lucky then that the story is good; and it is just about good enough to save the film. The plot features plenty of twists and turns; some work better than others, but there\\'s always enough going on to ensure that the film stays interesting. Director Sidney Lumet deserves some credit too as the style of the film is another huge plus. The central location is interesting in its own right, and the cinematography fits the film well.

       "  '\"Spoilers!<br /><br />From the very moment I saw a local film critic trash this movie in a review on the 10:00 news, I wanted to see it. I don\\'t remember who it was, or which local Omaha newscast carried the review, but the critic was very insistent that this film was way too sleazy for the average church-going Nebraskan. They showed a snippet from the scene where John Glover is about to kidnap Ann-Margret when she\\'s swimming in the pool. Glover\\'s character is commending her on how nice her body is and so forth, using many words that the local station felt necessary to edit out. I was hooked. There was one problem, though. I was only 13 years old at the time, and I had to wait a year until it came out on cable. Let\\'s just say, it was worth the wait!<br /><br />If ever there was a guilty pleasure of mine, this movie is it. To call this film sleazy would be a huge understatement. The film centers around a successful businessman who is blackmailed by three small time scumbags after an affair with a young woman. Roy Scheider, who is as effective as ever, plays the poor guy who just wanted a little fling and now finds himself at the mercy of three terrific villains. John Glover\\'s character is one of the most memorable scumbags of all time. He\\'s sleazy, funny at times, and always on the brink of doing something crazy. Then there\\'s Robert Trebor\\'s (nice name, by the way!) character Leo who is clearly in over his head with this blackmail scheme. He is a whimpering, sweating, coward who runs a peep show place with live nude models. Then, you have Clarence Williams III as Bobby Shy, a brooding sociopath who everyone is afraid of with good reason. Who could forget the wake-up call he gives Vanity with the giant teddy bear?<br /><br />After dealing with the initial shock of realizing what he\\'s up against, Scheider turns the tables on these creeps and takes control of the situation, that is until Glover goes after his wife! The conflict is played out brutally, with virtually the entire cast getting shot, raped, or blown up. <br /><br />I don\\'t know why I love this movie so much. It really should creep me out, but it doesn\\'t. Maybe it\\'s because these characters are all interesting, and the story takes plenty of chances that most films today would never try. It\\'s scary to think that the adult film industry probably has more than a few characters like Glover\\'s running around out in L.A. looking for trouble. Just thinking about his voice is enough to make me chuckle. \\\\\"Hey sport, have a nice day!\\\\\"<br /><br />This film has plenty of shootouts, cool cars, great dialog (like the line in my opening statement), and decent acting. Plenty of cameos by real life porno stars. Look for Ron Jeremy frolicking around in a hot tub with two chicks in a party scene at Glover\\'s place. <br /><br />Another thing I must add: How hot are the women in this film??? Wow! Travolta did right by marrying Kelly Preston. Yum! We also see Vanity get nude in a time before she became a born again Christian. And Ann-Margret. What else could you say about her except that she is the quintessential American Beauty. <br /><br />9 of 10 stars.<br /><br />So sayeth the Hound.<br /><br />Added Feb 14, 2008: RIP Roy Scheider!\"'],\n",

Coming off the success of her first romantic comedy, Ernst Lubitsch\\'s masterful \\\\\"Ninotchka\\\\\" (1939), where she was ideally cast as an austere Russian envoy, Garbo is reunited with her leading man Melvyn Douglas for a sitcom-level story that has her playing Karin Borg, a plain-Jane ski instructor who impulsively marries publishing executive Larry Blake when he becomes smitten with her. Once he makes clear that work is his priority, Karin inadvertently decides to masquerade as her high-living twin sister Katherine to test her husband\\'s fidelity when he is back in Manhattan.<br /><br />It\\'s surprising that this infamous 1941 misfire was directed by George Cukor, who led Garbo to her greatest dramatic performance in 1937\\'s \\\\\"Camille\\\\\", because this is as unflattering a vehicle as one could imagine for the screen legend. Only someone with Carole Lombard\\'s natural sense of ease and mischief could have gotten away with the shenanigans presented in the by-the-numbers script by S.N.

Photographed unflatteringly by Joseph Ruttenberg, Garbo looks tired in many scenes and downright hideous in her teased hairdo for the \\\\\"chica-choca\\\\\" dance sequence. The story ends conventionally but with the addition of a lengthy physical sequence where Larry tries to maneuver his skis on a series of mountain cliffs that unfortunately reminds me of Sonny Bono\\'s death.

Silverstein and Diaz soon find themselves enmeshed in a conspiracy involving Argentina\\'s intelligence community and some uranium, and the film separates them at a crucial point that allows Silverstein to develop some impressive sleuthing skills of his own. Peretti and Luque are excellent together and remind me of screen team Terence Hill and Bud Spencer, though Peretti isn\\'t as classically handsome as Hill. Remarkably, even at almost two hours in length Tiempo de Valientes doesn\\'t wear out its welcome, and indeed writer-director Damian Szifron sets up a potential sequel in the film\\'s charming coda.

They switched plans and decided to go to Thailand without telling their parents the change of plans. While they were in Thailand, Alice and Darlene met a really handsome guy named Nick Parks (Daniel Lapaine). He tells them that he would trade in his first class ticket to Hong Kong for three economy tickets so that they could spend the weekend in Hong Kong. They accepted his offer and upon entering the airport the two were arrested for smuggling drugs. They were convicted and sentenced to thirty three years in prison. <br /><br />I think Kaplan was trying to show the audience that it is wise to make good decisions because in one instance one bad decision can change the direction of a life forever. Also, a friendly face may not be as friendly as we think once we find out the real intentions of that friendly face. Those girls made a decision not to tell their parents that they had switched their plans and it changed their lives forever. Things have a funny way of happening showing us what decision we have made verses the decision that we should have made. Sometimes life is not fair, that is why it is important to think long and hard about the choices that we make because we can never go back and change the choices that we have made.<br /><br />This movie has a great setting; it was filmed mostly in Bangkok Thailand. This film also has great music; a few of my favorite songs are \\'Silence\\' by Delerium, \\'Damaged\\' by Plumb, \\'Deliver me\\' by Sarah Bightman and \\'Party\\'s just begun\\' by Nelly Furtado.

These girls where young and naive and failed to think their plans out thoroughly, a mistake that anyone could make, therefore this film is good for any audience.

This movie is to show what those \\\\\"genius\\\\\" people very often think and what problems they face.

Now, having seen it for the second time, so much later, I don\\'t find it hilarious. I don\\'t find ANYTHING hilarious anymore. But this is a witty and light-hearted comedy that moves along quickly without stumbling and I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br /><br />It\\'s 1945 and Fred MacMurray is a 4F who\\'s dying to get into one of the armed forces. He rubs a lamp in the scrapyard he\\'s managing and a genie appears to grant him a few wishes. (Ho hum, right? But though the introduction is no more than okay, the fantasies are pretty lively.) MacMurray tells the genie that he wants to be in the army. Poof, and he is marching along with Washington\\'s soldiers into a particularly warm and inviting USO where June Haver and Joan Leslie are wearing lots of lace doilies or whatever they are, and lavender wigs. Washington sends MacMurray to spy on the enemy -- red-coating, German-speaking Hessians, not Brits. The Hessians are jammed into a Bierstube and singing a very amusing drinking song extolling the virtues of the Vaterland, \\\\\"where the white wine is winier/ and the Rhine water\\'s Rhinier/ and the bratwurst is mellower/ and the yellow hair is yellower/ and the Frauleins are jucier/ and the goose steps are goosier.\\\\\" Something like that. The characterizations are fabulous, as good as Sig Rumann\\'s best. Otto Preminger is the suspicious and sinister Hessian general. \\\\\"You know, Heidelberg, vee are 241 to 1 against you -- but vee are not afraid.\\\\\" <br /><br />I can\\'t go on too long with these fantasies but they\\'re all quite funny, and so are the lyrics. When he wishes he were in the Navy, MacMurray winds up with Columbus and the fantasy is presented as grand opera. \\\\\"Don\\'t you know that sailing west meant/ a terrifically expensive investment?/ And who do you suppose provides the means/ but Isabella, Queen of Queens.\\\\\" When they sight the New World, someone remarks that it looks great. \\\\\"I don\\'t care what it looks like,\\\\\" mutters Columbus, \\\\\"but that place is going to be called Columbusland.\\\\\"<br /><br />Anyway, everything is finally straightened out, though the genie by this time is quite drunk, and MacMurray winds up in the Marine Corps with the right girl.<br /><br />I\\'ve made it sound too cute, maybe, but it IS cute. The kids will enjoy the puffs of smoke and the magic and the corny love story. The adults will get a kick out of the more challenging elements of the story (who are the Hessians?) unless they happen to be college graduates, in which case they might want to stick with the legerdemain and say, \\\\\"Wow!

It\\'s about the experiences of people who live for dance; the joys they experience, and the sacrifices they make. Each dancer is auditioning for parts in a Broadway chorus line, yet what comes out of each of them are stories of how their lives led them find dance as a respite. <br /><br />The film version, though, captures none of the passion or beauty of the stage show, and is arguably the worst film adaptation of a Broadway musical, as it is lifeless and devoid of any affection for dance, whatsoever. <br /><br />The biggest mistake was made in giving the director\\'s job to Sir Richard Attenborough, whose direction offered just the right touch and pacing for \\\\\"Gandhi.\\\\\" Why would anyone in his or her right mind ask an epic director to direct a musical that takes place in a fairly constricted place?<br /><br />Which brings us to the next problem. \\\\\"A Chorus Line\\\\\" takes place on stage in a theatre with no real sets and limited costume changes. It\\'s the least flashy of Broadway musicals, and its simplicity was its glory. However, that doesn\\'t translate well to film, and no one really thought that it would. For that reason, the movie should have taken us in the lives of these dancers, and should have left the theatre and audition process. The singers could have offered their songs in other environments and even have offered flashbacks to their first ballet, jazz or tap class. Heck, they could have danced down Broadway in their lively imaginations. Yet, not one shred of imagination went into the making of this film, as Attenborough\\'s complete indifference for dance and the show itself is evident in his lackadaisical direction.<br /><br />Many scenes are downright awkward as the dancers tell their story to the director (Michael Douglas) whether he wants to hear them or not. Douglas\\' character is capricious about choosing to whom he extends a sympathetic ear, and to whom he has no patience. <br /><br />While the filmmakers pretended to be true to the nature of the play, some heretical changes were made. The very beautiful \\\\\"Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love\\\\\"--a smashing stage number which took the dancers back to their adolescence--was removed and replaced with the dreadful, \\\\\"Surprise,\\\\\" a song so bad that it was nominated for an Oscar. Adding insult to injury, \\\\\"Surprise\\\\\" simply retold the same story as \\\\\"Hello, Love\\\\\" but without the wit or pathos.<br /><br />There is no reason to see this film unless you want a lesson in what NOT to do when transferring a Broadway show to film. If you want to see a film version of this show, the next closest thing is Bob Fosse\\'s brilliant \\\\\"All That Jazz.\\\\\" While Fosse\\'s daughter is in \\\\\"A Chorus Line,\\\\\" HE is the Fosse who should have been involved, as director.

But it is also my opinion that he does not break them successfully or to any actual point.<br /><br />Pasolini\\'s work is visually jarring, but this is less a matter of what is actually on the screen than how it is filmed, and the jumpiness of his films seem less a matter of artistic choice than the result of amateur cinematography. This is true of DECAMERON.

Director/co-writer Marry Harron and Guinevere Turner\\'s fantastic script is only marred by a too abrupt and not as clear as it should be ending. Still, credit must be given to the two ladies for creating a nearly flawless biopic that manages to pay tribute to both its subject and the decade it emulates masterfully.

       "  '\"After watching two of his silent shorts, \\'Elena and her Men (1956)\\' is my first feature-length film from French director Jean Renoir, and I quite enjoyed it. However, I didn\\'t watch the film for Renoir, but for star Ingrid Bergman, who \\x96 at age 41 \\x96 still radiated unsurpassed beauty, elegance and charm. Throughout the early 1950s, following her scandalous marriage to Italian Roberto Rossellini, Bergman temporarily fell out of public favour. Her next five films, directed by her husband, were unsuccessful in the United States, and I suspect that Renoir\\'s latest release did little to enhance Bergman\\'s popularity with English-speaking audiences {however, she did regain her former success with an Oscar in the same year\\'s \\'Anastasia (1956)\\'}. She stars as Elena Sokorowska, a Polish princess who sees herself as a guardian angel of sorts, bringing success and recognition to promising men everywhere, before promptly abandoning them. While working her lucky charms to aid the political aspirations of the distinguished General Francois Rollan (Jean Marais), she finds herself falling into a love that she won\\'t be able to walk away from. This vaguely-political film works well as either a satire or a romantic comedy, as long as you don\\'t take it too seriously; it\\'s purely lighthearted romantic fluff.<br /><br />Filmed in vibrant Technicolor, \\'Elena and her Men\\' looks terrific as well, a flurry of bright colours, characters and costumes. Bergman\\'s Polish princess is dreamy and somewhat self-absorbed, not in an unlikable way, but hardly a woman of high principles and convictions. She is persuaded by a team of bumbling government conspirators to convince General Rollan to stage a coup d\\'état, knowingly exploiting his love for her in order to satisfy her own delusions as a \\\\\"guardian angel.\\\\\" Perhaps the film\\'s only legitimately virtuous character is Henri de Chevincourt (Mel Ferrer, then Audrey Hepburn\\'s husband), who ignores everybody else\\'s selfish secondary motives and pursues Elena for love, and love alone. This, Renoir proudly suggests, is what the true French do best. \\'Elena and her Men\\' also attempts, with moderate success, to expose the superficiality of upper-class French liaisons, through the clumsy philandering of Eugène (Jacques Jouanneau), who can\\'t make love to his servant mistress without his fiancè walking in on them. For these sequences, Renoir was obviously trying for the madcap sort of humour that you might find in a Marx Brothers film, but the film itself is so relaxed and laid-back that the energy just isn\\'t there.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"I caught this stink bomb of a movie recently on a cable channel, and was reminded of how terrible I thought it was in 1980 when first released. Many reviewers out there aren\\'t old enough to remember the enormous hype that surrounded this movie and the struggle between Stanley Kubrick and Steven King. The enormously popular novel had legions of fans eager to see a supposed \\\\\"master\\\\\" director put this multi-layered supernatural story on the screen. \\\\\"Salem\\'s Lot\\\\\" had already been ruined in the late 1970s as a TV mini-series, directed by Tobe Hooper (he of \\\\\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\\\\" fame) and was badly handled, turning the major villain of the book into a \\\\\"Chiller Theatre\\\\\" vampire with no real menace at all thus destroying the entire premise. Fans hoped that a director of Kubrick\\'s stature would succeed where Hooper had failed. It didn\\'t happen.<br /><br />Sure, this movie looks great and has a terrific opening sequence but after those few accomplishments, it\\'s all downhill. Jack Nicholson cannot be anything but Jack Nicholson. He\\'s always crazy and didn\\'t bring anything to his role here. I don\\'t care that many reviewers here think he\\'s all that in this clinker, the \\\\\"Here\\'s Johnny!\\\\\" bit notwithstanding...he\\'s just awful in this movie. So is everyone else, for that matter. Scatman Crothers\\' character, Dick Halloran, was essential to the plot of the book, yet Kubrick kills him off in one of the lamest \\\\\"shock\\\\\" sequences ever put on film. I remember the audience in the theater I saw this at booing repeatedly during the last 45 minutes of this wretched flick, those that stayed that is...many left. King\\'s books really never translate well to film since so much of the narratives occur internally to his characters, and often metaphysically. Kubrick jettisoned the tension between the living and the dead in favor of style here and the resulting mess ends so far from the original material that we ultimately don\\'t really care what happens to whom.<br /><br />This movie still stinks and why so many think it\\'s a horror masterpiece is beyond me.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"A movie of outstanding brilliance and a poignant and unusual love story, the Luzhin Defence charts the intense attraction between an eccentric genius and a woman of beauty, depth and character.<br /><br />     It gives John Turturro what is probably his finest role to date (thank goodness they didn\\'t give it to Ralph Fiennes, who would have murdered it.) Similarly, Emily Watson shows the wealth of her experience (from her outstanding background on the stage). To reach the tortured chess master (Turturro) her character has to display intelligence as well as a woman\\'s love. Watson does not portray beauty-pageant sexuality, but she brings to her parts a self-awareness that is alluring.<br /><br />     In a chance meeting between Natalia (Watson) and Luzhin, she casually stops him from losing a chess piece that has fallen through a hole in his clothing - a specially crafted piece that, we realize later in the film, has come to symbolize his hopes and aspirations. Later, as their love affair develops, she subtly likens dancing to chess (Luzhin has learnt to dance but never with a partner); she encourages him to lead her with \\\\\"bold, brilliant moves\\\\\" and in doing so enables him to relax sufficiently to later play at his best (and also realize himself as her lover).<br /><br />     This is a story of a woman who inspires a man to his greatest achievement and, in so doing finds her own deepest fulfillment, emotionally and intellectually (Or so we are led to believe - certainly, within the time frame, Natalia is something of a liberated woman rather than someone who grooms herself to be a stereotypical wife and mother).<br /><br />     The Italian sets are stunning. The complexity of the characters and the skill with which the dialogue unfolds them is a delight to the intelligent movie-goer, yet the film is accessible enough to make it a popular mainstream hit, and most deservedly so. Chess is merely the photogenic backdrop for developing an emotional and emotive movie, although the game is treated with enough respect to almost convince a chess-player that the characters existed. Although a tragedy of remarkable heights by a classic author, the final denouement is nevertheless surprisingly uplifting.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"\\\\\"Scoop\\\\\" is also the name of a late-Thirties Evelyn Waugh novel, and Woody Allen\\'s new movie, though set today, has a nostalgic charm and simplicity. It hasn\\'t the depth of characterization, intense performances, suspense or shocking final frisson of Allen\\'s penultimate effort \\\\\"Match Point,\\\\\" (argued by many, including this reviewer, to be a strong return to form) but \\\\\"Scoop\\\\\" does closely resemble Allen\\'s last outing in its focus on English aristocrats, posh London flats, murder, and detection. This time Woody leaves behind the arriviste murder mystery genre and returns to comedy, and is himself back on the screen as an amiable vaudevillian, a magician called Sid Waterman, stage moniker The Great Splendini, who counters some snobs\\' probing with, \\\\\"I used to be of the Hebrew persuasion, but as I got older, I converted to narcissism.\\\\\" Following a revelation in the midst of Splendini\\'s standard dematerializing act, with Scarlett Johansson (as Sondra Pransky) the audience volunteer, the mismatched pair get drawn into a dead ace English journalist\\'s post-mortem attempt to score one last top news story. On the edge of the Styx Joe Strombel (Ian McShane) has just met the shade of one Lord Lyman\\'s son\\'s secretary, who says she was poisoned, and she\\'s told him the charming aristocratic bounder son Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman) was the Tarot Card murderer, a London serial killer. Sondra and Sid immediately become a pair of amateur sleuths. With Sid\\'s deadpan wit and Sondra\\'s bumptious beauty they cut a quick swath through to the cream of the London aristocracy.<br /><br />Woody isn\\'t pawing his young heroine muse -- as in \\\\\"Match Point,\\\\\" Johansson again -- as in the past. This time moreover Scarlett\\'s not an ambitious sexpot and would-be movie star. She\\'s morphed surprisingly into a klutzy, bespectacled but still pretty coed. Sid and Sondra have no flirtation, which is a great relief. They simply team up, more or less politely, to carry out Strombel\\'s wishes by befriending Lyman and watching him for clues to his guilt. With only minimal protests Sid consents to appear as Sondra\\'s dad. Sondra, who\\'s captivated Peter by pretending to drown in his club pool, re-christens herself Jade Spence. Mr. Spence, i.e., Woody, keeps breaking cover by doing card tricks, but he amuses dowagers with these and beats their husbands at poker, spewing non-stop one-liners and all the while maintaining, apparently with success, that he\\'s in oil and precious metals, just as \\\\\"Jade\\\\\" has told him to say.<br /><br />That\\'s about all there is to it, or all that can be told without spoiling the story by revealing its outcome. At first Allen\\'s decision to make Johansson a gauche, naively plainspoken, and badly dressed college girl seems not just unkind but an all-around bad decision. But Johansson, who has pluck and panache as an actress, miraculously manages to carry it off, helped by Jackman, an actor who knows how to make any actress appear desirable, if he desires her. The film actually creates a sense of relationships, to make up for it limited range of characters: Sid and Sondra spar in a friendly way, and Peter and Sondra have a believable attraction even though it\\'s artificial and tainted (she is, after all, going to bed with a suspected homicidal maniac).<br /><br />What palls a bit is Allen\\'s again drooling over English wealth and class, things his Brooklyn background seems to have left him, despite all his celebrity, with a irresistible hankering for. Jackman is an impressive fellow, glamorous and dashing. His parents were English. But could this athletic musical comedy star raised in Australia (\\\\\"X-Man\\'s\\\\\" Wolverine) really pass as an aristocrat? Only in the movies, perhaps (here and in \\\\\"Kate and Leopold\\\\\").<br /><br />This isn\\'t as strong a film as \\\\\"Match Point,\\\\\" but to say it\\'s a loser as some viewers have is quite wrong. It has no more depth than a half-hour radio drama or a TV show, but Woody\\'s jokes are far funnier and more original than you\\'ll get in any such media affair, and sometimes they show a return to the old wit and cleverness. It doesn\\'t matter if a movie is silly or slapdash when it\\'s diverting summer entertainment. On a hot day you don\\'t want a heavy meal. The whole thing deliciously evokes a time when movie comedies were really light escapist entertainment, without crude jokes or bombastic effects; without Vince Vaughan or Owen Wilson. Critics are eager to tell you this is a return to the Allen decline that preceded \\\\\"Match Point.\\\\\" Don\\'t believe them. He doesn\\'t try too hard. Why should he? He may be 70, but verbally, he\\'s still light on his feet. And his body moves pretty fast too.\"'],\n",

The plot, again, wasn\\'t exactly original, but proved undeniably engaging on a juvenile level and the leading characters well enough developed - especially interesting is the villainous Ice-lord Nekron and the enigmatic warrior Darkwolf; the hero and heroine, however, are rather bland stereotypes - but one can hardly complain when Bakshi and Frazetta depict the girl as well-endowed (her bra could be torn off any second) and half-naked to boot (her tiny panties are forever disappearing up her ass)! Still, it\\'s clearly an action-oriented piece and it certainly delivers on this front (that involving Darkwolf being particularly savage); the final showdown though brief, is also nicely handled and sees our heroes astride pterodactyls assaulting the villains\\' lair inside a cave .<br /><br />In the long run, apart from the afore-mentioned Frazetta backdrops, the main appeal of this movie for me now is its nostalgia factor as it transported me back to my childhood days of watching not just films like CONAN THE BARBARIAN (1982) and THE BEASTMASTER (1982) but also animated TV series such as BLACKSTAR (1981-82) and HE-MAN AND THE MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE (1983-85).<br /><br />As for the accompanying THE MAKING OF \\\\\"FIRE AND ICE\\\\\" (TV) (Mark Bakshi, 1982) **1/2:<br /><br />Vintage featurette on the sword-and-sorcery animated film which is only available via the washed-out VHS print owned by Ralph Bakshi himself!

       "  '\"Having just seen the A Perfect Spy mini series in one go, one can do nothing but doff one\\'s hat - a pure masterpiece, which compared to the other Le Carré minis about Smiley, has quite different qualities.<br /><br />In the minis about Smiley, it is Alex Guiness, as Smiley, who steals the show - the rest of the actors just support him, one can say.<br /><br />Here it is ensemble and story that\\'s important, as the lead actor, played excellently by Peter Egan in the final episodes, isn\\'t charismatic at all. <br /><br />Egan just plays a guy called Magnus Pym, who by lying, being devious and telling people what they like to hear, is very well liked by everyone, big and small. The only one who seems to understand his inner self is Alex, his Czech handler.<br /><br />Never have the machinery behind a spy, and/or traitor, been told better! After having followed his life from a very young age we fully understand what it is that makes it possible to turn him into a traitor. His ability to lie and fake everything is what makes him into \\'a perfect spy\\', as his Czech handler calls him. <br /><br />And, by following his life, we fully understand how difficult it is to get back to the straight and narrow path, once you\\'ve veered off it. He trundles on, even if he never get anything economic out of it, except promotion by his MI5 spy masters. Everyone\\'s happy, as long as the flow of faked information continues! <br /><br />Magnus\\'s father, played wonderfully by Ray McAnally, is a no-good con-man, who always dreams up schemes to con people out of their money. In later years it is his son who has to bail him out, again and again. But by the example set by his dad and uncle, who takes over as guardian when his father goes to prison, and his mom is sent off to an asylum, Magnus quickly learns early that lying is the way of surviving, not telling the truth. At first he overdoes it a bit, but quickly learn to tell the right lies, and to be constant, not changing the stories from time to time that he tell those who want to listen about himself and his dad.<br /><br />His Czech handler Alex, expertly played by Rüdiger Weigang, creates, with the help of Magnus, a network of non-existing informants, which supplies the British MI5 with fake information for years, and years, just as the British did with the German spies that were active in the UK before and during the war - they kept on sending fake information to Das Vaterland long after the agents themselves had been turned, liquidated or simply been replaced by MI5 men.<br /><br />The young lads who play Magnus in younger years does it wonderfully, and most of them are more charismatic than the older, little more cynic, and tired, Pym, played by Egan. But you buy the difference easily, as that is often the way we change through life, from enthusiasm to sorrow, or indifference.<br /><br />Indeed well worth the money!\"'],\n",

There was a lot of character development which made the film better to watch, then after the kid came back to life as the scarecrow, there was a mindless hour and ten minutes of him killing people. The violence was overly excessive and i think the bodycount was higher than twelve which is a large number for movies like this. ALmost every character in the film is stabbed or gets their head chopped off, but the teacher who called him \\\\\"white trash\\\\\" and \\\\\"hoodlum\\\\\" (though the character lester is anything but a hoodlum, not even close, i know hoods and am part hood, they don\\'t draw in class, they sit there and throw stuff at the teacher). The teacher deserved a more gruesome death than anyone of the characters, but was just stabbed in the back. There were two suspenseful scenes in the film, but didn\\'t last long enough to be scary at all. As i said, the killings were excessive and sometimes people who have nothing to do with the story line get their heads chopped off. If the gore was actually fun to see, then it would\\'ve been nc-17. Two kids describe a body they find in the cornfields, they describe it as a lot gorier than it actually was, they explained to the cop that there were maggots crawling around in the guys intestines. His stomach had not even been cut open so there was no way maggots were in his stomach, though i would\\'ve liked to see that. The acting was pathetic, characters were losers, and the scarecrow could do a lot of gymnastix stunts.

       "  '\"Being a fan of the first Lion King, I was definitely looking forward to this movie, but I knew there was really no way it could be as good as the original. I know that many Disney fans are wary of the direct-to-video movies, as I have mixed feelings of them as well.<br /><br />While watching The Lion King 1½, I tried to figure out what my own viewpoint was regarding this movie. Am I going to be so devout about The Lion King that I will nitpick at certain scenes, or am I just going to accept this movie as just another look at The Lion King story? Most of the time, I found myself embracing the latter.<br /><br />The Lion King 1½ definitely has its cute and funny moments. Timon and Pumbaa stole the show in the first movie and definitely deserved a movie that centered around them. People just love these characters! My favorite parts of the movie include the montage of Timon & Pumbaa taking care of young Simba and the surprise ending featuring some great cameos.<br /><br />I could have done without many of the bathroom jokes though, like the real reason everyone bowed to baby Simba at the beginning of Lion King 1. I guess those types of jokes are for the younger set (which after all is the target audience. I don\\'t think many kids are really concerned about Disney\\'s profit margin on direct-to-video movies.)<br /><br />However, I will say that I was somewhat annoyed when they directly tied in scenes from the original movie to this movie. I\\'m just too familiar with the original that those scenes just stuck out like sore thumbs to me. Something would be different with the music or the voices that it would just distract me.<br /><br />As for the music, it wasn\\'t too bad, but don\\'t expect any classics to come from this movie. At least LK2 had the nice ballad, \\\\\"Love Will Find a Way.\\\\\" As for the voicework, it was well done in this movie. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella did a great job as always, and even new cast members, the classic comedic actor Jerry Stiller and Julie Kavner (best known as Marge Simpson), did a great job also. You can even enjoy these great voice talents even more by checking out the Virtual Safari on Disc 2 of the DVD. That feature is definitely a lot of fun!!<br /><br />So all in all, The Lion King 1½ isn\\'t a perfect movie, but it\\'s cute and entertaining. I think many Lion King fans will enjoy it and appreciate it for what it is - a fun, lighthearted look at the Lion King masterpiece from our funny friends\\' perspectives.<br /><br />My IMDb Rating: 7/10.

I am not quite sure what they mean by \\\\\"ground-breaking\\\\\" and \\\\\"original\\\\\" when they fawn all over Lynch and his silly little TV opus. What exactly is their criteria of what is original? Sure, compared to the \\\\\"Bill Cosby Show\\\\\" or \\\\\"Hill Street Blues\\\\\" it\\'s original. Definitely. Next to \\\\\"Law & Order\\\\\" TP spews originality left and right.<br /><br />Fans of TP often say that the show was canceled because too many viewers weren\\'t smart enough, open enough for the show\\'s supposed \\\\\"weirdness\\\\\", its alleged wild ingenuity, or whatever. As a fan of weirdness myself, I have to correct that misconception. There is nothing too off-the-wall about TP; it is a merely watchable, rather silly whodunit that goes around in circles, spinning webs in every corner but (or because of it) ultimately going nowhere. The supposed weirdness is always forced; the characters don\\'t behave in a strange way as much as they behave in an IDIOTIC way half the time. There\\'s a difference...<br /><br />Whenever I watch the \\\\\"weird dream\\\\\" sequence in \\\\\"Living In Oblivion\\\\\" in which the dwarf criticizes the director (Buscemi) for succumbing to the tired old let\\'s-use-a-midget-in-a-dream-scene cliché, I think of Lynch. You want weird? \\\\\"Eraserhead\\\\\" is weird - in fact, it\\'s beyond weird, it\\'s basically abstract. You want a unique TV show? Watch \\\\\"The Prisoner\\\\\". You want a strange-looking cast? Felini\\'s and Leone\\'s films offer that. TP looks like an overly coiffed TV crime drama in which all the young people look like fashion models. The cast gives TP a plastic look. Kens & Barbies en masse.<br /><br />In fact, one of the producers of TP said that Lynch was looking for \\\\\"unique faces\\\\\" for the series. Unique faces? Like Lara Flynn Boyle\\'s? Sheryll Fenn\\'s? Like those effeminate-faced \\\\\"hunks\\\\\" straight out of men\\'s catalogs (or gay magazines)? Don\\'t get me wrong; there is nothing wrong with getting an attractive cast, especially with beauties like Fenn (the way Madonna would look if she were 1000 times prettier), but then don\\'t go around saying you\\'re making a \\\\\"weird show with weird-looking people\\\\\". And I have never understood Lynch\\'s misguided fascination with Kyle MacLachlan (I should get a medal for bothering to spell his name right). He is not unlikable, but lacks charisma, seeming a little too bland and polished. His character\\'s laughable \\\\\"eccentricities\\\\\" were not at all interesting, merely one of Lynch\\'s many attempts to force the weirdness, trying hard to live up to his reputation - him having completely lost his edge but that time. Everything Lynch made post-\\\\\"Elephant Man\\\\\" was very much sub-par compared to his first two movies. What followed were often mediocre efforts that relied on Lynch\\'s relatively small but fanatical fan base to keep him in the public eye by interpreting meanings into his badly put-together stories that don\\'t hold any water on closer scrutiny. In other words, Lynch is every intellectual-wannabe\\'s darling. <br /><br />So Laura Palmer was killed by her Dad...? He was obsessed by the devil or some such nonsense.

As the summer warms on, they fall in love and, when the holidays end, decide to live together. A year later, the relationship ends in catastrophe: Cédric cheats on Mathieu who, distraught, tries to take his own life. He survives and, in order to get perspective back on his life he returns to the seaside town where they first met, this time cloaked in the chill of winter.<br /><br />If the tale was told like this it would never have the impact it does: much of it is implied, all of it happens non-sequentially.<br /><br />The intricate narrative is essential to getting a deeper feeling of the passions experienced, through the use of counterpoint and temporal perspective. Fortunately, the three time-lines used (the summer of love, the post-suicide psychiatric hospital and the winter of reconstruction) are colour coded: warm yellows and oranges for the summer, an almost frighteningly chill blue for the hospital scenes and warming browns and blues for the winter seaside.<br /><br />Both main actors put in excellent performances though, whilst it\\'s a delight to see Stéphane Rideau (Cédric) used to his full capacity (I\\'m more used to seeing him under-stretched in Gael Morel\\'s rather limp dramas), Jérémie Elkaim (Mathieu) has to be singled out for special mention: you can feel his loneliness, then his almost incredulous passion, then his character crumbling behind a wall of aphasia. Beautifully crafted gestures get across far more than dialogue ever could.<br /><br />The themes touched upon are almost classic in French cinema: our difficulty in really understanding what another is feeling; our difficulty in communicating fully; the shifting sands of meaning\\x85 The film\\'s title \\\\\"Presque rien\\\\\" (Almost Nothing) points to all of these and, indeed, to one of the key scenes in the film: In trying to understand why Mathieu attempted to kill himself, a psychiatrist asks Cédric if he had ever cheated on him\\x85 \\\\\"Non\\x85 enfin, oui\\x85 une fois, mais ce n\\'était rien\\\\\" (No\\x85 well, yes\\x85 once, but it was nothing). Cédric still loves Mathieu \\x96 he brought him to the hospital during the suicide attempt (none of which we see) and tries desperately to contact him again once he leaves \\x96 but cannot understand that he has lost him forever, because something that seemed nothing to him (a meaningless affair) is everything to Mathieu.<br /><br />Whilst the film is darker than the rather unfortunate Pierre et Gilles poster would suggest, it is not without hope: we get to see Cédric\\'s slow, painful attempts to get back in touch with life, first through a cat he adopts, then through work in a local bar and finally contact with Pierre, who may be his next love. But here the story ends: A teenage passion, over within the year, another perhaps beginning. So what was it? Almost Nothing? Certainly not when you\\'re living it\\x85\"'],\n",

       "  '\"\\\\\"A Town Called Hell\\\\\" (aka \\\\\"A Town Called Bastard\\\\\"), a British/Spanish co-production, was made on the heels of Clint Eastwood\\'s success in the Italian made \\\\\"Man With No Name\\\\\" trilogy. The template used in most of these films was to hire recognizable American actors, whose careers were largely in decline and dub their voices. This film is no exception except for the fact that they used some British actors as well.<br /><br />It\\'s difficult to summarize the plot, but here goes. The story opens with rebels or whatever, led by Robert Shaw and Marin Landau raiding a church and killing everyone inside, including the priest. Fast forward to the subject town a few years later where the Shaw character is masquerading as a priest. The mayor of the town (Telly Savalas) is a brutal leader who thinks nothing of meting out justice with his gun.<br /><br />Throw into the mix a grieving widow Alvira (Stella Stevens) who is searching for her husband\\'s killer. Add to this the fact that she rides around in a hearse lying dead like in a coffin for God knows why. After the mayor is murdered by his henchman La Bomba (Al Lettieri) the town is invaded by a federale Colonel (Landau) in search of a rebel leader (I\\'m sorry but the name escapes me). The Colonel takes over the town and begins summarily executing the townsfolk to force them to reveal the identity of the leader.<br /><br />Even though they opened the film side by side, its difficult to tell from the dialog that the Landau and Shaw characters know each other. A blind man (Fernando Rey) claims he can identify the rebel leader by touching his face. He does so and..............................................<br /><br />I\\'m sure the principals regretted making this film. It\\'s just plain awful and well deserving of my dreaded \\\\\"1\\\\\" rating. Shaw spends most of the film fixating his trademark stare at whomever is handy. Even Landau can\\'t salvage this film. The beautiful Ms. Stevens is totally wasted here too. Having just made Peckinpah\\'s \\\\\"The Ballad of Cable Hogue\\\\\" the previous year, I found it odd that she would appear in this mess of a movie. Savalas made several of these pictures, (\\\\\"Pancho Villa\\\\\" and \\\\\"Horror Express\\\\\" come to mind) during he pre-Kojak period.Michael Craig is also in it somewhere as a character called \\\\\"Paco\\\\\".<br /><br />Fernando Rey appeared in many of these \\\\\"westerns\\\\\" although he would emerge to play the villain in the two \\\\\"French Connection\\\\\" films. Al Lettieri would also emerge with a role in \\\\\"The Godfather\\\\\" (1972) and go on to other memorable roles before his untimely death in 1975.<br /><br />In all fairness, the version I watched ran only 88 minutes rather than the longer running times of 95 or 97 minutes listed on IMDb, however I can\\'t see where an extra 7 or 8 minutes would make much difference.<br /><br />Avoid this one.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"(SPOILERS IN FIRST PARAGRAPH) This movie\\'s anti-German sentiment seems painfully dated now, but it\\'s a brilliant example of great war-time propaganda. It was made back when Cecil B. DeMille was still a great director. (Ignore all his later Best Picture Academy Awards; he never made a very good sound film.) This movie lacks the comedy of most of Pickford\\'s other films, and really it was DeMille\\'s movie, not Pickford\\'s. The vilification of the Germans can be compared to the way \\\\\"The Patriot\\\\\" of 2000 did the same to the British. The only good German in the film was a reluctant villain who had the ironic name of Austreheim. They even had Pickford take an ill-fated trip on a luxury ship that gets torpedoed by a German submarine. So what\\'ll get the Americans more stirred up to war? The sinking of the Lusitania, or watching America\\'s favorite Canadian import sinking in it? All throughout the film DeMille runs his protagonist from one kind of horrible calamity to another, barely escaping death, hypothermia, depravity, rape, execution, and explosions that go off in just the right place to keep her unharmed. The way she is saved from a firing squad is no more believable than the way the humans in \\\\\"Jurassic Park\\\\\" were ultimately rescued from the velociraptors. If I was any more gullible to such propaganda I would punish myself for having a part-German ancestry. <br /><br />Was it a good film? Aside from a humorous running gag about Americans abroad thinking they\\'re untouchable \\x96 that was apparently a joke even back then \\x96 you might not be entertained. You\\'ll find it more than a little melodramatic, and obviously one-sided, but the first thing that came to my mind after watching it is that it was years before Potemkin\\'s false portrayal of a massacre revolutionized the language of cinema as well as a movie\\'s potential for propaganda. It made me wonder: what became of Cecil B. DeMille? Somewhere between the advent of sound and \\\\\"The Greatest Show on Earth\\\\\" he seemed to lose his ambition. Ben Hur looked expensive, but not ambitious. In a sentence, this movie is for 1) Film historians, 2) Silent Film Buffs, 3) Mary Pickford fans, or 4) DeMille fans, if such a person exists.\"'],\n",

May be the first one which portrayed the stark reality of corruption in the police force & politics with no holds barred & how it effects on a young cop. A man forced to join a career of a cop by his cop father. Agreed that we grew up watching lot of good cop/bad cop Hindi films but this is different. Today\\'s generation, which grown up watching dark & realistic films like- \\'Satya\\', \\'Company\\' may be consider it inferior product in comparison but look at the time of its making. The film was made absolutely off beat tone in the time when people didn\\'t pay much attention to such kind of cinema & yet it becomes a most sought after cop film in class & mass audience when it released. For Om Puri its first breakthrough in mainstream Hindi cinema & he delivered a class performance as Inspector Velankar. Its more than cop character, he internalized a lot which is something original in acting. Watch his scenes with his father whom he hates & Smita whom he loves. Smita Patil maintained the dignity of her character to the expected level. My God what a natural expressions she carried!!! Shafi Inamdar was truly a discovery for me & he\\'s a brilliant character actor if given a chance & here in some of the scenes he outsmarted even Om. The movie is also a debut of a promising villain on Indian screen- Sadashiv Amrapurkar as \\'Rama Shetty\\'.

Lame ending that will likely make viewers angry.<br /><br />Final thoughts: This is a comedy? If it is then why are the really funny bits so few and far in between?

       "  '\"Mario Lanza, of course, is \\\\\"The Great Caruso\\\\\" in this 1951 film also starring Ann Blyth, Dorothy Kirsten, Eduard Franz and Ludwig Donath. This is a highly fictionalized biography of the legendary, world-renowned tenor whose name is known even today.<br /><br />The film is opulently produced, and the music is glorious and beautifully sung by Lanza, Kirsten, Judmila Novotna, Blanche Thebom, and other opera stars who appeared in the film. If you\\'re a purist, seeing people on stage smiling during the Sextet from \\\\\"Lucia\\\\\" will strike you as odd - even if Caruso\\'s wife Dorothy just had a baby girl. Also it\\'s highly unlikely that Caruso ever sang Edgardo in Lucia; the role lay too high for him.<br /><br />In taking dramatic license, the script leaves out some very dramatic parts of Caruso\\'s life. What was so remarkable about him is that he actually created roles in operas that are today in the standard repertoire, yet this is never mentioned in the film. These roles include Maurizio in Adriana Lecouvreur and Dick Johnson in \\\\\"Girl of the Golden West,\\\\\" There is a famous photo of him posing with a sheet wrapped around him like a toga. The reason for that photo? His only shirt was in the laundry. He was one of the pioneers of recorded music and had a long partnership with the Victor Talking-Machine Company (later RCA Victor). He was singing Jose in Carmen in San Francisco the night of the earthquake.<br /><br />Instead, the MGM story basically has him dying on stage during a performance of Martha, which never happened. He had a hemorrhage during \\\\\"L\\'Elisir d\\'amore\\\\\" at the Met and could not finish the performance; he only sang three more times at the Met, his last role as Eleazar in La Juive. What killed him? The same thing that killed Valentino - peritonitis. His first role at the Met was not Radames in Aida, as indicated in the film, but the Duke in Rigoletto. So when it says on the screen \\\\\"suggested by Dorothy Caruso\\'s biography of her husband,\\\\\" that\\'s what it was - suggested. What is true is that Dorothy\\'s father disowned her after her marriage, and left her $1 of his massive estate. They also did have a daughter Gloria together (who died at the age of 79 on 10/7/2007). However, Caruso had four other children by a mistress before he married Dorothy.<br /><br />Some people say that Lanza\\'s voice is remarkably like Caruso\\'s, but just listen to Caruso sing in the film \\\\\"Match Point\\\\\" -- Caruso\\'s voice is remarkably unlike Lanza\\'s. In fact, from his sound, had he wanted to, Caruso could have sung as a baritone. He is thought to have had some trouble with high notes, further evidence of baritone leanings; and the role he was preparing when he died was Othello, a dramatic tenor role, which Lanza definitely was not. Lanza\\'s voice deserved not to be compared with another. He made a unique contribution to film history, popularizing operatic music. He sings the music in \\\\\"The Great Caruso\\\\\" with a robust energy; he is truly here at the peak of what would be a short career. His acting is natural and genuine. Ann Blyth is lovely as Dorothy and gets to sing a little herself.<br /><br />Really a film for opera lovers and Lanza fans, which are probably one and the same.\"'],\n",

Keaton plays a pet store owner in the 1930s who catches a kid stealing a puppy and then tells him, in flashback, how he came to own the pet store. He turned to thievery at a young age to get his mother a pancreas operation ($49.95, special this week) and began working for a mob boss (Boyle). Johnny uses the last name \\\\\"Dangerously\\\\\" in the mobster world.<br /><br />There are some hilarious scenes in this film, and Stapleton is a riot as Johnny\\'s foul-mouthed mother who needs ever organ in her body replaced.

       "  '\"Yes, this production is long (good news for Bronte fans!) and it has a somewhat dated feel, but both the casting and acting are so brilliant that you won\\'t want to watch any other versions!<br /><br />Timothy Dalton IS Edward Rochester... it\\'s that simple. I don\\'t care that other reviewers claim he\\'s too handsome. Dalton is attractive, certainly, but no pretty-boy. In fact he possesses a craggy, angular dark charm that, in my mind, is quite in keeping with the mysterious, very masculine Mr R. And he takes on Rochester\\'s sad, tortured persona so poignantly. He portrays ferocity when the scene calls for it, but also displays Rochester\\'s tender, passionate, emotional side as well. (IMO the newer A&E production suffers in that Ciaran Hinds - whom I normally adore - seems to bluster and bully his way throughout. I\\'ve read the book many times and I never felt that Rochester was meant to be perceived as a nonstop snarling beast.)<br /><br />When I reread the novel, I always see Zelah Clarke as Jane. Ms. Clarke, to me, resembles Jane as she describes herself (and is described by others). Small, childlike, fairy... though it\\'s true the actress doesn\\'t look 18, she portrays Jane\\'s attributes so well. While other reviews have claimed that her acting is wooden or unemotional, one must remember that the character spent 8 years at Lowood being trained to hold her emotions and \\\\\"passionate nature\\\\\" in check. Her main inspiration was her childhood friend Helen, who was the picture of demure submission. Although her true nature was dissimilar, Jane learned to master her temper and appear docile, in keeping with the school\\'s aims for its charity students who would go into \\'service\\'. Jane becomes a governess in the household of the rich Mr. Rochester. She would certainly *not* speak to him as an equal. Even later on when she gave as well as she got, she would always be sure to remember that her station was well below that of her employer. Nevertheless, if you read the book - to which this production stays amazingly close - you can clearly see the small struggles Zelah-as-Jane endures as she subdues her emotions in order to remain mild and even-tempered.<br /><br />The chemistry between Dalton and Clarke is just right, I think. No, it does not in the least resemble Hollywood (thank God! It\\'s not a Hollywood sort of book) but theirs is a romance which is true, devoted and loyal. And for a woman like Jane, who never presumed to have *any* love come her way, it is a minor miracle.<br /><br />The rest of the casting is terrific, and I love the fact that nearly every character from the book is present here. So, too, is much of the rich, poetic original dialogue. This version is the only one that I know of to include the lovely, infamous \\'gypsy scene\\' and in general, features more humor than other versions I\\'ve seen. In particular, the mutual teasing between the lead characters comes straight from the book and is so delightful!<br /><br />Jane Eyre was, in many ways, one of the first novelized feminists. She finally accepted love on her own terms and independently, and, at last, as Rochester\\'s true equal. Just beautiful!\"'],\n",

However, despite its pretensions, VAMPYRES\\' wafer-thin plot and rough-hewn production values will divide audiences from the outset, and while the two female protagonists are as charismatic and appealing as could be wished, the male lead (Brown, past his prime at the time of filming) is woefully miscast in a role that should have gone to some beautiful twentysomething stud.

The last season felt like the season too much for every single character, simply because Eric used to take a lot of screen time and now we\\'d be smashed in the face by how stale and repetitive the rest of the characters were. Focusing on the gimmick that is Fez was thoroughly uninteresting and the character would simply stop working, because the whole deal was that he\\'d say something weird from out of nowhere, and you can\\'t say stuff from out of nowhere when every second line is yours. They also brought in the standard cousin Oliver, only this time it just wasn\\'t a kid. Whenever you heard somebody knock on the door, you started praying it wasn\\'t Randy, please let it not be Randy. The deal with Randy was that he\\'d do really awful jokes, usually as Red would say, smiling like an ass and totally screwing up delivery and Donna would be in stitches. I think more than half of the last season was Donna pretending to be amused. The problems had started earlier though: what once was a truly great show with an equally great concept that for once wasn\\'t about a dysfunctional family slowly got into the territory of soap opera. Everybody started being in love with everybody, emotional scenes were dragged out at nausea, with just one usually lame joke placed somewhere to divert attention that we were watching \\\\\"As The World Turns\\\\\". I\\'m guessing this was character development, but come on that was written almost as clumsily as the moral lessons from \\\\\"Family Matters\\\\\". To be fair, the last episode, also because it had a cameo by Topher Grace (a cameo in his own show), was really good, even if not that funny either.<br /><br />By the way, yet more criticism on Season 8: what the hell was with the opening theme? Not only did they use the same joke twice (a character not singing), Fez scared the hell out of me. Dude, don\\'t open your eyes that far. But the first five seasons or so,among the best comedy ever broadcast.\"'],\n",

We could not take our eyes off the screen where the young crippled man whose entire body was against him and who only had a control over his left foot, picked up a piece of chalk with his foot and for what seemed the eternity tried to write just one word on the floor. When he finished writing that one word, we all knew that we had witnessed not one but three triumphs - the triumph of a human will and spirit, the triumph of the cinema which was able to capture the moment like this on the film, and the triumph of an actor who did not act but who became his character.<br /><br />Jim Sheridan\\'s \\\\\"My Left Foot\\\\\" is an riveting, unsentimental bio-drama about Christy Brown, the man who was born with cerebral palsy in a Dublin slum; who became an artist and a writer and who found a love of his life.<br /><br />I like every one of Day Lewis\\'s performances (I have mixed feelings about his performance in GONY) but I believe that his greatest role was Christy Brown in \\\\\"My Left Foot\\\\\"\"'],\n",

Ollie goes to the roof to help with the other end of the brush at the top of the chimney, but Stan in the living room ends up pushing the him back in the attic. After breaking an extension, Stan gets a replacement, a loaded gun, from off the wall, and of course it fires the brush off. Stan goes up to have a look, and Ollie, standing on the attic door of the roof, falls into the greenhouse. Stan asks if he was hurt, and Ollie only answers with \\\\\"I have nothing to say.\\\\\" Ollie gets back on the roof, and he and Stan end up in a tug and pull squabble which ends up in Ollie falling down and destroying the chimney. Ollie, hatless, in the fireplace is hit on the head by many bricks coming down, and the butler Jessup (Sam Adams) is covered in chimney ash smoke, oh, and Ollie still has nothing to say to Stan. The boys decide to clean up the mess, and when Stan tears the carpet with the shovel, Ollie asks \\\\\"Can\\'t you do anything right\\\\\", and Stan replies \\\\\"I have nothing to say\\\\\", getting the shovel bashed on his head. As Ollie holds a bag for Stan to shovel in the ashes, they get distracted by a painting on the wall, and the ashes end up down Ollie\\'s trousers, so Stan gets another shovel bashed on the head. Professor Noodle finishes his formula, and does a final test on a duck, with a drop in a tank of water, changing it into a duckling.

While he\\'s gone, the boys decide to test the formula for themselves, but Ollie ends up being knocked by Stan into the water tank with all the formula.

It was obvious the locals would be involved in some way at some stage but Essendon clearly has no idea how to build suspense in a movie. Finally, when something does happen, its not even clear how the father was shot, how he dies, (the nurse said his liver was only grazed), and all the time this wendigo spirit apparently tracks down the apparent shooter in a very clumsy way with 3rd grade special effects.

In short, it\\'s no different from 90% of Hollywood product. But it\\'s the racial angle that makes \\'Set It Off\\' a particularly saddening example of contemporary film-making.

The gimmick this time is that the gangstas are wearing drag. Not only does the film suggest that gangsterism is a default identity for all African Americans strapped for cash or feeling a bit hassled by the Man, it presents its sistas as shallow materialists who prize money and bling above all else. Worse, \\'Set It Off\\' exploits the theme of racial discrimination and disadvantage simply as a device to prop up its feeble plot structure. Serious race-related social issues are wheeled on in contrived and opportunistic fashion in order to justify armed robbery, then they\\'re ditched as soon as the film has to produce the inevitably conventional ending in which crime is punished, the LAPD turns out to be a bunch of caring, guilt-ridden liberals (tell that to Rodney King), and aspirational \\'good\\' sista, Jada Pinkett Smith, follows the path of upward mobility out of the \\'hood and into a world of middle-class self-indulgence opened up for her by her buppie bank-manager boyfriend. \\'Set It Off\\' illustrates the abysmal state of the contemporary blaxploitation film, pandering to mindless gangsta stereotypes and pretending to celebrate life in the \\'hood while all the time despising it. While the likes of \\'Shaft\\' and \\'Superfly\\' in the 1970s might have peddled stereotypes and rehashed well-worn plots, they had a freshness, an energy and an innocence that struck a chord with audiences of all races and still makes them fun to watch. \\'Set It Off\\' wouldn\\'t be worth getting angry over if wasn\\'t a symptom of the tragic decline and ghettoisation of African-American film-making since the promising breakthrough days of the early 1990s.\"'],\n",

But changes are that if you liked all the aforementioned movies, you will also enjoy MIDNIGHT OFFERINGS.<br /><br />I was expecting a silly and cheesy early 80\\'s movie about teenage witches in high school. But I was rather surprised that this whole movie plays it rather serious. The acting is decent and serious all the time. No jokes are being played by teenagers or something. And the musical score, at first, I thought was pretty good. It added some scariness and also something \\'classy\\', with the use of threatening violins and all. But as the movie progressed I came to the conclusion that the score was just too ambitious. They didn\\'t have to add those threatening violins when you simply see someone back up a car and then drive away at normal speed.<br /><br />Then there\\'s Melissa Sue Anderson, who was the main reason for me to see this movie. A few weeks ago, I saw her in HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME, a rather enjoyable, thick-plotted (and goofy on some occasions) slasher-movie which she had done in the same year as MIDNIGHT OFFERINGS. And I must say, she was very good as the icy-cold bad witch Vivian. But the main problem with the movie is: almost nothing happens! Vivian causes a death and an accident, yes, but that\\'s it. Then there\\'s Robin, the good witch, who is just learning about her powers. And we expect the two of them using their powers more than once, but at only one occasion they use their powers to make some pieces of wood and other stuff fly through the air as projectiles. That was supposed to be a fight between two powerful witches? And what\\'s worse, I was hoping to see a spectacular show-down between the witches at the end of the movie with at least some special effects, flaming eyes or whatever... but nothing happens. There is sort of a confrontation in the end, but it\\'s a big disappointment.<br /><br />So, the acting of the two witches was good. The musical score was decent (even though overly ambitious).

Pneumonic plague is loose in the streets of New Orleans, and it is up to a military doctor (Widmark) and a city detective (Douglas) to apprehend the main carrier (Palance). The film is moody, shot in stark black and white, and makes very good use of locations. Widmark is wonderful as usual. Forget the symbolism (crime equals disease, and disease equals crime) and just enjoy the chase. It is not always easy watching a film like this now that we are well into this new century, as it is of a particular style that was very short-lived (post WWII through the early 1950s) and will unlikely be of interest to the casual film watcher.

Charles lures pretty virgins into his arms, drawing their energy, in turn \\\\\"feeding\\\\\" his hungry mama, Mary(Alice Krige). The fresh new target is Tanya Robertson(Mädchen Amick), and she seems to be easy pickens, but this will not be the case and when Charles is seriously injured in a struggle(..thanks to a deputy\\'s cat, Clovis), Mary\\'s vengeance will be reaped on all those who get her way. Mary, come hell or high water, will retrieve Tanya in the goal of \\\\\"refreshing\\\\\" her dying son.<br /><br />Like many teenagers, I had a crush on certain actresses I watched in movies. Such as Amy Dolenz, I was smitten with Mädchen Amick. She\\'s simply adorable in this movie and I love how she bites her lower lip displaying an obvious attraction towards Charles, unaware of his ulterior motives. I just knew that Mädchen Amick would be destined to be a scream queen, but this would never be the case. Too bad because I would\\'ve welcomed her in the genre with open arms.<br /><br />Krige is yummy as the menacing, damn sexy, but vicious and mean bitch who wipes out an entire police force and poor Tanya\\'s parents in one fail swoop, in less than ten or so minutes. She stabs one in the back with a corn cob! She bites the fingers off of poor Ron Perlman, before cracking his arm(..a bone protruding), knocking him unconscious with his own elbow! She tosses Tanya\\'s mom through a window after breaking a rose vase over her father\\'s face! A deputy is stabbed in his ear by Charles(Cop-kebab!), falling on the pencil for extra impact. Poor Tanya is dragged by her hair from her home by Mary, driven to the Brady home, and forced into an impromptu dance with the crippled monster! The sheriff is hurled onto a picket fence and we see how cats combat the sleepwalkers unlike humans. We see Mary and Charles\\' abilities to \\\\\"dim\\\\\" themselves and his car using a power of invisibility. Writer Stephen King even finds time to include himself and horror director buddies of his in a crime scene sequence with Clive Barker and Tobe Hooper as forensics officers, Joe Dante and John Landis as photograph experts.<br /><br />The film is shot in a tongue-in-cheek, let-it-all-hang-out manner with music appropriately hammering this technique home. It\\'s about the ultra-violence, simple as that, with some deranged behavior and jet black humor complimenting Garris\\' direction and King\\'s screenplay. The incestuous angle of the sleepwalkers is a bit jarring and in-your-face. Without a lick of complexity, this is closer in vein to King\\'s own demented MAXIMIMUM OVERDRIVE than his more serious works.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"\\\\\"Pickup On South Street\\\\\" is a high speed drama about a small time criminal who suddenly finds himself embroiled in the activities of a group of communists. The action is presented in a very direct and dynamic style and the momentum is kept up by means of some brilliant editing. The use of a wide variety of different camera angles and effective close-ups also contribute to the overall impression of constant motion and vitality. Samuel Fuller\\'s style of directing and the cinematography by Joseph MacDonald are excellent and there are many scenes which through their composition and lighting produce a strong sense of mood and atmosphere.<br /><br />Ace pickpocket and repeat offender Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark) gets into deep water when he steals a wallet from a young woman named Candy (Jean Peters) on the New York subway. She was being used by her ex-boyfriend Joey (Richard Kiley) to make a delivery to one of his contacts in a communist organisation and unknown to her, she was carrying US Government secrets recorded on microfilm. Two FBI agents had been following Candy and witnessed the theft. One of the agents continues to tail her back to Joey\\'s apartment and the other, Zara (Willis Bouchey), visits Police Captain Dan Tiger (Murvyn Vye). Zara explains that the FBI has been following Candy for some months as part of their pursuit of the ringleader of a communist group.<br /><br />In order to identify the pickpocket, Tiger calls in a \\\\\"stoolie\\\\\" called Moe (Thelma Ritter) who after being given a precise description of the \\\\\"cannon\\'s\\\\\" method of working makes a list of eight possible suspects. Once Tiger sees Skip\\'s name on the list he\\'s immediately convinced that he\\'s the man that they need to track down and he sends two detectives to arrest him. When Skip is brought into Tiger\\'s office, Zara tells him about the microfilm and Tiger offers to drop any charges if he\\'ll co-operate with the investigation. Skip is flippant and arrogant. He clearly doesn\\'t trust Tiger and denies all knowledge of the theft on the subway.<br /><br />Joey orders Candy to find out who stole the microfilm and then retrieve it. Candy pays Moe for Skip\\'s address and when Skip returns from being questioned by Tiger, he finds Candy searching his home and knocks her unconscious before stealing her money. When she recovers, Skip demands payment of $25,000 for the microfilm. She tells Joey about Skip\\'s demand and Joey\\'s boss gives him a gun and orders him to recover the microfilm by the following evening.<br /><br />Skip and Candy are attracted to each other and it\\'s because of their uneasy, developing relationship that a means evolves by which they are able to shake off the attentions of the police. It soon becomes apparent, however, that resolving matters with the communist gang will only be achieved by more direct action.<br /><br />The depictions of Skip, Candy and Moe as characters that inhabit a seedy world in which they are forced to face considerable risks on a daily basis are powerful and compelling.<br /><br />Moe\\'s work as a police informer is dependent on her knowledge of the people in her community but also those people know what she does and any one of them could seek their revenge at any time. She appears to be cunning and streetwise but also has her vulnerable side as she describes herself as \\\\\"an old clock running down\\\\\" and saves money to be able to have a decent burial in an exclusive cemetery in Long Island. Her belief that \\\\\"every buck has a meaning of its own\\\\\" leads her to sell any information regardless of danger, friendships or principles and yet there is one occasion where she refuses and this proves fatal. Thelma Ritter\\'s performance certainly merited the Oscar nomination she earned for her role.<br /><br />Skip is a violent criminal with no concern for his victims and having already been convicted three times in the past, lives under the constant threat of being jailed for life if convicted again. Despite this, he still continues with his criminal activities and strangely, is merely philosophical when Moe betrays his whereabouts and then later, he even ensures that Moe receives the type of burial she valued so highly. Candy is an ex-hooker and someone whose activities constantly put her in peril but behind her hardened exterior a warmer side gradually becomes more evident. Widmark and Peters are both perfect for their roles and like Ritter portray the different facets of their personalities with great style and conviction.\"'],\n",

In any case, poor Lloyd could\\'ve been snarling that line at the speechless audience as much as he was his put-upon co-star.<br /><br />Hard as it is for most of us to believe, especially these days, nobody in Hollywood sets out to INTENTIONALLY make a bad movie.

Here we have all the ingredients in a recipe guaranteed to produce a monumentally fallen soufflé: Pia Zadora, a marginal singer/actress so determined to be taken seriously, that she would take on practically anything that might set her apart from her peers, (which this movie most certainly did!); a somewhat high-profile novel written by the Trashmaster himself, Harold Robbins (of THE CARPETBAGGERS and DREAMS DIE FIRST fame); a cast who probably thought they were so fortunate to be working at all, that they tried to play this dreck like it was Clifford Odets or Ibsen; plus a director who more than likely was a hired gun who kept the mess moving just to collect a paycheck, (and was probably contractually obligated NOT to demand the use of the \\'Alan Smithee\\' moniker to protect what was left of his reputation.)

The only thing about this 80 minute opus that has anything to do with \\\\\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\\\\" is the title. Otherwise, everything else in this lackluster production is new and not worth watching. In fact, the director has written here at IMDb.COM that he directed only eight minutes of \\\\\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\\\\" and the studio tacked on part of \\\\\"Dollman\\\\\" helmer Albert Pyun\\'s sequel to his own \\\\\"Alien from L.A.\\\\\" with Kathy Ireland. Evidently, the producers ran out of money and to satisfy overseas contractual obligations, they grafted Pyun\\'s sequel onto director Rusty Lemorande\\'s movie. Please, don\\'t rent or buy this wretched piece of garbage.<br /><br />Unlike director Henry Levin\\'s period piece \\\\\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\\\\" (1959) with James Mason and Pat Boone, Lemorande\\'s \\\\\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\\\\" takes place in contemporary times in Hawaii. Two fellows, a British nanny, and a dog are brought together for the adventure of a lifetime purely by coincidence. Richard (Paul Carafotes of \\\\\"Blind Date\\\\\") and his comic book obsessed brother Bryan (Ilan Mitchell-Smith of \\\\\"Weird Science\\\\\") are going out to explore a cave. The heroine, Crystina (Nicola Cowper of \\\\\"Underworld\\\\\"), works for a domestic service called \\'Nannies R Us.\\' Being a nanny has been Crystina\\'s life-long dream, but she has made a less of all five of her nanny jobs. Nevertheless, her sympathetic supervisor, Ms. Ferry (Lynda Marshall of \\\\\"Africa Express\\\\\"), sends her to Hawaii. Crystina\\'s new client, rock star Billy Foul (Jeremy Crutchley of \\\\\"Doomsday\\\\\") who is scheduling one last concert to revive his flagging career, has a dog named Bernard. Foul wants Crystina to take Bernard to a doggie day spa. Crystina is waiting on the arrival of her taxi when a careless motel attendant accidentally puts the basket that conceals Bernard in Richard\\'s jeep. You see, Foul has hidden his canine in a basket because motel management strictly prohibits pets on their premises. Foul has disguised the dog as a human baby. Anyway, Crystina catches a cab and tells the driver follow Richard.<br /><br />After she catches up with them to get her dog, the cabbie cruises away and abandons her. Crystina demands that Richard drive her back to town, but he has other plans. Unhappily, Crystina joins the guys and they get lost, and then find themselves in the lost city of Atlantis, a police state ruled by a dictator, at the center of the Earth. The rulers of Atlantis repeatedly notify their citizens that life on the surface does not exist. Our heroes and heroine stumble onto Atlantis quite by accident. Atlantis resembles a disco and everybody looks like they are straight out of a punk rock opera. The ruler of Atlantis, General Rykov (Janet Du Plessis of \\\\\"Operation Hit Squad\\\\\"), is orchestrating a raid on the surface with clones of the first human, Wanda Saknussemm (Kathy Ireland of \\\\\"Necessary Roughness\\\\\"), to visit Atlantis. Predictably, General Rykov machinations to rule Atlantis and overthrow the Earth fails, and our heroes and heroine save the day.<br /><br />\\\\\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\\\\" is an abomination.

Flynn plays an ambitious, egotistical young man who has a natural talent for boxing and is sponsored by the exclusive Olympic Club in San Francisco in the late 1800s. Though good-natured, the fact that he is a \\\\\"shanty Irishman\\\\\" and a social climber builds resentment in Olympic Club members; most of them can\\'t wait to see him lose a fight, and they bet against him. Despite this, he rises to fame, even working as an actor. Finally he gets the chance he\\'s been waiting for, a match with the world champion, John L. Sullivan (Ward Bond). Sullivan demands a $10,000 deposit to insure that Corbett will appear to fight for the $25,000 purse. Corbett and his manager (Frawley) despair of getting the money. However, help comes in the form of a very unlikely individual.<br /><br />This is a very entertaining film, and Jim Corbett is an excellent role for Flynn, who himself was a professional fighter at one time. He has the requisite charm, good looks and athleticism for the role. Alexis Smith plays Victoria Ware, his romantic interest who insists that she hates him. In real life, she doesn\\'t seem to have existed; Corbett was married to Olive Lake Morris from 1886 to 1895.<br /><br />The focus of the film is on Corbett and his career rather than the history of boxing. Corbett used scientific techniques and innovation and is thought of as the man who made prizefighting an art form. In the film, Corbett is fleet of foot and avoids being hit by his opponents; it is believed that he wore down John L.

       "  '\"I saw this film on the History Channel today (in 2006). First of all, I realize that this is not a documentary -- that it is a drama. But, one might hope that at least the critical \\\\\"facts\\\\\" that the story turns on might be based on actual events. Reagan was shot and the other characters were real people. The movie got that right. From there on, reliance on facts rapidly decays. I had never heard of this movie before seeing it. Having been a TV reporter at the time of these events, I was stunned that I had never heard anything about the bizarre behavior of Secretary Haig as portrayed by Richard Dreyfuss. The whole nation had heard the \\\\\"I am in control...\\\\\", etc., but Dreufuss\\' Haig is bullying a cowered cabinet and totally out of control personally. Having watched the film, I began researching the subject on the Internet and quickly found actual audio tapes and transcripts of most of the Situation Room conversations that this film pretends to reenact. Incredibly, many the the principal \\\\\"facts\\\\\" of the film meant to show a White House, Secret Service etc. in total chaos -- and the nation\\'s leadership behaving irrationally and driving the world near the brink of nuclear war -- are demonstrably incorrect. They didn\\'t happen! There is internal conflict, to be sure. Haig makes missteps, his press room performance is historically regrettable and he is \\\\\"difficult\\\\\". But there is nothing approaching the scenes depicted in the film. There are too many gross errors to list, but any fair comparison of the recorded and written record and the fantasy of this film begs the question as to what the producers were really trying to accomplish. Enlighten? Inform? Entertain? I believe they failed on all three fronts. It is difficult to ascribe motives to others, but one must seriously question what was behind such shameless invention. And, as for my beloved History Channel\\'s \\\\\"Reel to Real\\\\\" follow-on documentary, there was almost no mention of the issues that were the central focus of the film -- namely the events within the Administration on the day of the shooting. So, the viewer was left to research those without much -- if any -- help from the network.\"'],\n",

I decided to watch it myself earlier this week.<br /><br />It is a reasonably entertaining piece containing two completely separate story lines. The section with Michelle Pfeiffer was by far the more interesting of the two. She plays a rising Hollywood actress who has had many short unfulfilling relationships. She literally bumps into Brian Kerwin (A regular married guy with Kids)after driving her car into the back of his. After being initially hostile to one another he offers to drive her home as she no longer feels comfortable to drive. Romance develops eventually leading to tragedy when his wife finds out. What happens at the end I was not prepared for but the slow pacing and routine TV direction takes any drama out of the plot.<br /><br />The other section involves an old Studio boss played by Darren McGavin. This section actually has the better cast with Kenneth McMillan, Lois Chiles, Steven Bauer & Stella Stevens. They all want something from the studio boss but in the end when he is asked to resign, they all realize their careers will now be going nowhere. <br /><br />It passes the time but is not all that interesting and I am glad this was not bought for me. I am not a Michelle Pffeifer fan but she was admittedly the only actor worth watching in this film and even in 1983 she was a decent actress.

       "  '\"As a Dane I\\'m proud of the handful of good Danish movies that have been produced in recent years. It\\'s a terrible shame, however, that this surge in quality has led the majority of Danish movie critics to lose their sense of criticism. In fact, it has become so bad that I no longer trust any reviews of Danish movies, and as a result I have stopped watching them in theaters.<br /><br />I know it\\'s wrong to hold this unfortunate development against any one movie, so let me stress that \\\\\"Villa Paranoia\\\\\" would be a terrible film under any circumstances. The fact that it was hyped by the critics just added fuel to my bonfire of disillusionment with Danish film. Furthermore, waiting until it came out on DVD was very little help against the unshakable feeling of having wasted time and money. <br /><br />Erik Clausen is an accomplished director with a knack for social realism in Copenhagen settings. I particularly enjoyed \\\\\"De Frigjorte\\\\\" (1993). As an actor he is usually funny, though he generally plays the same role in all of his movies, namely that of a working-class slob who\\'s down on his luck, partly because he\\'s a slob but mostly because of society, and who redeems himself by doing something good for his community. <br /><br />This is problem number one in \\\\\"Villa Paranoia\\\\\"; Clausen casts himself as a chicken farmer, which is such a break from the norm that he never succeeds in making it credible. <br /><br />It is much worse, however, that the film has to make twists and turns and break all rules of how to tell a story to make the audience understand what is going on. For instance, the movie opens with a very sad attempt at visualizing the near-death experience of the main character with the use of low-budget effects and bad camera work. After that, the character tells her best friend that she suddenly felt the urge to throw herself off a bridge. This is symptomatic of the whole movie; there is little or no motivation for the actions of the characters, and Clausen resorts to the lowest form of communicating whatever motivation there is: Telling instead of showing. Thus, at one point, you have a character talking out loud to a purportedly catatonic person about the way he feels, because the script wouldn\\'t allow him to act out his feelings; and later on, voice-over is abruptly introduced, quite possibly as an afterthought, to convey feelings that would otherwise remain unknown to the audience due to the director\\'s ineptitude. Fortunately, at this point you\\'re roughly an hour past caring about any of the characters, let alone the so-called story.<br /><br />The acting, which has frequently been a problem in Clausen\\'s movies, can be summed up in one sad statement: Søren Westerberg Bentsen, whose only other claim to stardom was as a contestant on Big Brother, is no worse than several of the heralded actors in the cast.<br /><br />I give this a 2-out-of-10 rating.\"'],\n",

But why quibble with an obvious attempt to bribe its male viewers when nothing will change it now? Deathtrap is funny, sophisticated, witty, and classy.

So I would not recommend it to anyone on the basis of being a San Francisco movie. You will not be thinking \\\\\"oh, I\\'ve been there,\\\\\" you will be thinking \\\\\"how did a two story firetrap/stinky armpit turn into a quiet hotel lobby?\\\\\" Some of the leads used East Coast speech styles and affectations. It detracts, but the acting was always competent.<br /><br />The stories seemed to be shot in three distinct styles, at least in the beginning. The Chinatown story was the most effective and interesting. The plot is weak, ripped scene for scene from classy Hong Kong action movies. The originals had a lot more tension and emotional resonance, they were framed and paced better. But the acting is fun and we get to see James Hong and other luminaries.<br /><br />The white boy intro was pointless. I think the filmmakers didn\\'t know what to do with it, so they left it loosely structured and cut it down. The father is an odd attempt at a Berkeley liberal - really, folks, everyone knows it\\'s not \\\\\"groovy\\\\\" to live in the ghetto - but his segments are the most humorous. They threw away some good opportunities. Educated and embittered on the West Coast, a yuppie jerk here is a different kind of yuppie jerk than they make in New York. They are equally intolerable but always distinguishable. That would have been interesting; this was not.<br /><br />The Hunter\\'s Point intro was the most disappointing. It was the most derivative of the three, and stylistically the most distant from San Francisco. You\\'ve seen it done before and you\\'ve seen it done better. Even the video game was better! <br /><br />Despite the generic non-locality and aimless script, these characters have potential, the actors have talent, and something interesting starts to force its way around the clumsy direction... about ten minutes before the ending. Good concept placed in the wrong hands.<br /><br />PS, there is a missing minority here, see if you can guess which one.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"******WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**************<br /><br />So who are these \\\\\"Mystery Men?\\\\\" Simply put, the Mystery Men are a group of sub-Heroes desperately trying to live out their adolescent fantasy lives while botching both their real identities and their super identities. The Shoveller (Bill Macy) works construction during the day, and at night, leaves his wife and kids at home while he cruises the street looking for crimes to tackle with his extraordinary and unique Shovel-fighting style. The Blue Raja (Hank Azaria) sells silverware to newlyweds by day and flings tableware at crackpot villians by night, if his mom isn\\'t keeping him busy with the latest snooping. Mr. Furious works in a junk yard to earn his pay, then takes out his frustration on his friends at night, tossing ill-conceived one-liners at friend and foe alike and threatening to get really angry (leaving everyone to wonder, So What?). Ben Stiller breathes such life into this character, you can\\'t help but love him.<br /><br />These three spend their nights trying to capture that \\'moment of glory\\' they\\'ve dreamed about... becoming real Super Heroes. Obviously, it could happen. Champion City has Captain Amazing, after all... a flying, fighting super-cop with enough corporate logos on his costume to stop an extra bullet or two. Greg Kinnear turns in a stellar performance as a middle-aged sellout trying to recapture his fans attention in the twilight of his career.<br /><br />To bring back that \\'extra magic\\' that might win the endorsements again, C.A. frees Casanova Frankenstein, a WAAAAAY over-the-top menace played to chilling perfection by Goeffrey Rush. This lunatic genius has created a \\'psychofrakulator\\' to warp Champion City into a reflection of his own insanities... and ends up capturing C.A. within hours of his release from prison. This leaves only the Mystery Men to stop Frankenstein\\'s evil plan, but with such henchmen as the Disco Boys protecting Frankenstein, the trio are going to need a little help.<br /><br />Recruiting commences, and after a painful recruitment party, the team settles in with The Bowler (Janeane Garofolo), who initially has the only real talent in the team, with her mystic bowling ball seemingly animated by the vengeful spirit of her dead father; the Invisible Boy (Kel Mitchell), who CLAIMS to turn invisible when ABSOLUTELY NO ONE is looking at him; the Spleen (Paul Reubens), granted mystically powerful flatulence by an angry gypsy; and the much underused Sphinx (Wes Studi), who is shown to be able to cut guns in half with his mind, then spends much of the rest of the movie spouting inane riddles and acting over-wise.<br /><br />This film really is a cross-genre romp. Anyone wanting to pigeon-hole films into neat little categories is fighting a losing battle. This is a spoof/parody of the superhero genre - from the pseudo-Burton sets recycled endlessly (and occasionally decorated with more spoof material) to the ridiculous costumes, the comic-book genre gets a pretty good send-up. But at the same time, it is a serious superhero flick, as well. Both at once. While not a necessarily unique idea in itself (for example, this movie is in some ways reflective of D.C. Comic\\'s short-lived Inferior Five work), it is fairly innovative for the big screen. It offers the comic-book world that requires a suspension of disbelief to accept anyway, then throws in the inevitable wanna-bes - and we all know, if superheroes were real, so would these guys be real. If the Big Guy with the S were flying around New York City, you\\'d see a half-dozen news reports about idiots in underwear getting their butts kicked on a regular basis. Sure, the Shoveller fights pretty well, and the Blue Raja hurls forks with great accuracy - all parts of the super-hero world. But does that make them genuine super-heroes? Only in their minds.<br /><br />This movie is also a comedy, albeit a dark one. Inevitable, when trying to point out the patent ridiculous nature of super-heroics. One-liners fly as the comic geniuses on stage throw out numerous bits to play off of. Particularly marvelous is the dialogue by Janeane Garofalo with her bowling ball/father. Yet, it isn\\'t a comedy in the sense of side-splitting laughter or eternally memorable jokes. It mixes in a dose of drama, of discovery and of romance, but never really ventures fully into any of it.<br /><br />What really makes Mystery Men a good film, in the end, is that it is very engaging. The weak/lame good guys are eventually justified and, for one shining moment, really become super-heroes; justice is served; and the movie ends with a scene that reeks of realism (as much realism as is possible in a world where bowling balls fly and glasses make the perfect disguise). If the viewer stops trying to label the film, then the film can be a great romp.<br /><br />Of course, no movie is perfect. Claire Forlani comes off as bored and directionless as Mr. Furious\\' love interest, in spite of having a pivotal role as his conscience. Tom Waits seems somehow confused by his own lines as the mad inventor Dr. Heller, although his opening scenes picking up retired ladies in the nursing home is worth watching alone. And the villians are never more than gun-toting lackeys (a point of which is made in the film). The cinematography is choppy and disjointed (such as happens in the average comic book, so it is excusable), the music sometimes overpowers the scenery, and the special effects are never quite integrated into the rest very well.<br /><br />Yet, overall, this film is incredible. You probably have to be a fan of comics and the superhero genre to really appreciate this movie, but it\\'s a fun romp and a good way to kill a couple of hours and let your brain rest.<br /><br />8/10 in my opinion.\"'],\n",

As the film begins, they are crossing the border from Mexico to the USA and for the first time in years, they are going to relax and stop running.<br /><br />The problem for me was that the family was too perfect and too decent--making them seem like obvious positive propaganda instead of a real family suffering through real problems. While this had a very noble goal at the time, it just seems phony today. In particular, the incredibly odd and extremely scripted dialog used by the children just didn\\'t ring true. It sounded more like anti-Fascism speeches than the voices of real children. They were as a result extremely annoying--particularly the littlest one who came off, at times, as a brat. About the only ones who sounded real were Bette Davis and her extended American family as well as the scumbag Romanian living with them (though he had no discernible accent).<br /><br />It\\'s really tough to believe that the ultra-famous Dashiel Hammett wrote this dialog, as it just doesn\\'t sound true to life. The story was based on the play by his lover, Lillian Hellman. And, the basic story idea and plot is good,...but the dialog is just bad at times. Overall, an interesting curio and a film with some excellent moments,...but that\\'s really about all.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"First off, if you\\'re planning on watching this, make sure to watch the UNCUT version (although it is very interesting to go back and then watch the scenes that were tampered with due to censorship), it makes a HUGE difference. This film is about a young woman, played by Barbara Stanwyck, who since the age of 14 has been forced into prostitution by her own father. When her father suddenly passes away, she is able to go out into the world on her own. After reading about Nietzsche\\'s philosophies on life, she uses her sexuality to manipulate men into giving her what she wants and leaves them in ruins and desperate for her love. Throughout the movie she becomes increasingly materialistic and manipulative and the audience begins to wonder is she has any sense of morality left at all. Overall, Baby Face is a very shocking movie with blatant scenes of sexuality that most people would not expect to see in a black and white film. While no sexual acts are explicitly shown on screen, it is very obvious what is happening off camera.<br /><br />I enjoyed watching this film very much and I believe most modern audiences will get at least some enjoyment out if it, especially with the films shock value. I did think while watching it that the pacing seemed a bit slow at parts, but I think that about most movies the first time is see them. Actually, I think that almost all movies I\\'ve seen made from the early 30\\'s had some minor pacing problems or certain parts just didn\\'t quite \\\\\"flow\\\\\" right. This was probably just the craft of film-making wasn\\'t quite perfected yet \\x96 it would take just a few more years. Compare a film from 1939 and compare it with an early 30\\'s film and I think you\\'ll see what I mean.<br /><br />Once again, I\\'m very glad I was able to watch the original cut; it really does make a big difference.

Yes, the scenery and the buildings are beautiful, and there is a brief but beautiful erotic interlude, but otherwise this movie is just a complete waste of time. Annamarie alternates between sulking and getting high/stoned/passing out on whatever drug or booze is handy, and Ella inexplicably puts up with this abominable behavior through the entire movie. At no time are we given any insight into why this is so, or even why Annamarie is so depressed and withdrawn.<br /><br />If there had at least been some kind of closure in the (potentially romantic? we don\\'t even know!) relationship between the two, there might have been some kind of satisfaction. But although Annamarie at one point asks Ella \\\\\"why do you love me?\\\\\" Ella doesn\\'t even acknowledge this. It\\'s never really clear whether this is anything more than an (ill-behaved) Lesbian on a boring road trip with a straight woman.<br /><br />Even the interactions between the two women and the local people they meet on the journey, which could have been lively and informative, are instead flat, tedious and mostly incomprehensible.<br /><br />There is one good joke in the movie, although I\\'m sure it was unintentional. The women travel in a two-seat Ford coupe with a middling sized trunk. Yet when they set up camp, they have an enormous tent, cots, sleeping gear, and even a table, chair, and typewriter! On top of that, when they board a ferry, we see piles of luggage, presumably theirs, presumably also carried in the little Ford\\'s trunk! <br /><br />And through the entire film, we never see one gas station, or anywhere that looks like it would actually have any place to buy gasoline. Mostly they travel through endless miles of desolate desert. So where did they get fuel?<br /><br />There may not be too many Lesbian films out there, good or bad, but there are plenty that are better than this, and very few that are worse.

A lot (all?) of this movie was filmed in genuine New Orleans locations, which makes it interesting to look at for what is now period detail, though to me it does look under-exposed, even for noir - maybe mobile lighting rigs then weren\\'t what they are. There is also a plenty of location background noise, which is slightly distracting - car horns in the love scene, anyone? There are a lot of non-professional supporting artists in crowd scenes, and this may explain why the pacing of the film is slightly saggy to begin with - not much chance for retakes or recasting, though the final chase is worth hanging on for. There\\'s not much wrong with the lead actors either: Jack Palance is genuinely scary as a charismatic, intelligent psychopath - the later scene as he alternately comforts and threatens the sick cousin is terrific, while Widmark, as he often did, pitches the righteous anger of the man on a mission at a believable level - most of the time. <br /><br />Somebody should remake this - no supernaturals, no mysticism, no special FX, just a good yarn full of character conflict, and a topical theme.

Tony hides her love for West. Then Zenia left west, with cash from Tony, then West and Tony get together. Eventually marry, at some point West leaves Tony for Zenia again for a short time. Only to be heart broken again. Then go back to Tony. Zenia\\'s blackmail for Tony was that Tony had written a test paper for Zenia. Now being a Professor at College she didn\\'t want to let it get out. I will say the character who played Tony did it wonderfully.<br /><br />Charis character was a blond, not that it really matters. Zenia didn\\'t trick her about having cancer while Augusta was alive. No she was there when Charis had a lover named billy. Augusta\\'s father, he was a draft dodger in the Vietnam war. Eventually after Charis takes care of Zenia for months for what was actually drug withdrawal. Zenia and Billy have an affair right under Charis\\'s nose while taking care of them both. Then Zenia turns in Billy to the government, and leaves on the ferry with him. Not with Augusta, Charis was pregnant with her tho. Charis also had a split personality, Karen was her real name.<br /><br />Zenia did not die from being cut up into piece\\'s.... she fell or was possibly pushed (we never really knew) off the balcony and landed in a fountain.

       "  '\"If one sits down to watch Unhinged, it is probably because its advertisements, video boxes, whatever, scream that it was banned in the UK for over 20 years (as virtually every video nasty does). It\\'s true; exploitation and taboo excites people and draws them in with their promise of controversy. Being an exploitation fan, however, none of this was new to me. The advertisements that scream that the film was banned in the UK don\\'t necessarily make me want to watch it; in fact, the first thing that usually pops into my head is how disgustingly paranoid British censors are. How I came to viewing this then is simple: it promised gore and it was only $6.99. The price alone alerted me not to have any hopes of this being the next Halloween, but a cheap padding of your DVD collection never hurts. I did force myself, however, to watch it all in one sitting, because I find that deciding to save the rest for another day makes you even less inspired to finish it. So anyway, after 90 minutes of Unhinged, I found that I had come across the cheapest sleeping aid in existence. I think the distributors could make a fortune if they simply changed their marketing technique.<br /><br />The layout of Unhinged is of any common slasher from the 80s. There\\'s unnecessary shower scenes and exploitative gore. That\\'s about it. Anyway, it starts with a group of three attractive co-eds crashing their car on the way to a concert. Though two of them (Terry and Nancy) are okay, one (Gloria) is severely injured and is out of commission for the rest of the movie. They are rescued and receive shelter at a mansion (that happens to have no phone, of course) with rather strange occupants: Marion is a middle-aged woman with a man-hating mother who constantly accuses Marion of sneaking men into the house in order to sleep with them (echoes of Psycho?). She also happens to have a crazy brother Carl who lives in the woods, because her mother\\'s hatred for men is so intense that she refuses to let him stay in the house. After hanging with Marion for awhile, Terry (our \\\\\"hero\\\\\") and Nancy decide they must contact their parents. Despite everyone\\'s warnings, Nancy braves the dangerous woods to make it to a phone (her fate is not hard to predict). After that, we see Gloria again, who is then promptly butchered with an ax. When Terry discovers that Gloria has disappeared from her room, she decides something isn\\'t right with this picture and sets out to find her missing friends. That may be easier said than done, however, with crazy Carl lurking around\\x85 <br /><br />After viewing Unhinged, I read an overwhelming number of reviews declaring that Unhinged worked perfectly because it took its time to build its subject matter that created real tension by the time the moment of truth comes at the end. Normally, I do not drag other people\\'s opinions into my reviews (especially when they contradict my views), but in this case, I was so puzzled by their reactions that I thought it would be relevant to mention. This is because in actuality, the film crawls. Normally for the slow-building tactic to work, the audience must have a strong sense that the characters are in danger. Oh sure, we see two of them get murdered, but between that are endless scenes of conversation and boredom. We are aware that there\\'s a killer on the loose, but this is only focused on three times in the film; that means there\\'s no reason to fear for the victims. Instead, the film\\'s events are explained not by the actions of the characters, but are drawn out for us by perpetual talking. If there\\'s one thing I can assure you from watching this, it\\'s that scenes of characters merely conversing with each other for 75 minutes are very tedious. None of this is helped by the atrocious acting. It seems that this was another case of the director needing actors and decided to gather his friends around instead of finding anyone with experience.<br /><br />Of course, I\\'d be a liar if I said there wasn\\'t one part of the movie that I enjoyed. Specifically, the ending was one of the best I\\'ve ever seen in a slasher film; you just do not expect that to happen. Just knowing that the director had the balls to do something like that is spectacular. Ah, I won\\'t spoil it for you, nor will I say that the ending completely makes up for the rest of the slow-moving film, but it definitely will get your attention. Other than that, the other two murder scenes bring at least some faster paced material, but it\\'s not like you couldn\\'t tell exactly who was going to die fifteen minutes into the film. Anyone looking for a bloodbath will be disappointed, however; those are the only scenes of gore present. That and, of course, no one scene can save an entire movie. I normally preach the doctrine that as long as there\\'s action, the worse a movie is, the better it gets. Unhinged only grasps one part of this concept. The whole film just feels Luke-warm; there\\'s potential alright, but the director either wasn\\'t experienced enough to make it work or just didn\\'t know what the hell he was doing.\"'],\n",

At the beginning you know whats going to happen, but none soever the story is not that easy to figure out from beginning to end, it is a ride between a father and his son, and a husband and his wife.

Sometimes by his side and sometimes his adversary there was one man who Carl Brashear really admired. His name was Master Chief Billy Sunday (Robert DeNiro). Sunday in a lot of ways pushed, aggravated and helped Carl become the man he wanted to be. <br /><br />I loved Cuba in this film. His portrayal here is as liberating and as powerful as Denzel Washington was in The Hurricane. Through every scene we can see his passion, motivation and stubbornness to achieve his dream. We can see the struggle within in him as he embarks to make his father proud. I also loved how the director created and brought forth a lot of tension in some of the key diving scenes. Brashear\\'s encounter with a submarine during a salvage mission is heart-stopping and brilliant. <br /><br />The only fault I could see would have to lie in the supporting cast.

Cmdr. Hanks, Sunday\\'s wife (Charlize Theron), the eccentric diving school colonel (Hal Holbrook) and Cuba\\'s love interest are the characters I found to not have very much depth.

In the process, she witnesses and endures many things: the gelding of a stallion, the rape of a local woman by a new Duke, the torture of a nun who was overcome during a visit by the Tarantula Sect, and a whipping herself when she ran off with a Jew. The torture was particularly gruesome with hot wax being poured on the nun, and her nipples cut off.<br /><br />Sister Flavia is bound to continue to get into trouble as she questions the male-dominated society in which she lives. She even asks Jesus, why the father, son and holy ghost are all men.<br /><br />Eventually, she joins the leader of the Muslims as his lover and they sack the convent.

       "  '\"As it is generally known,anthology films don\\'t fare very well with American audiences (I guess they prefer one standard plot line). New York,I Love You, is the second phase of a series of anthology films dealing with cities & the people who live & love in them. The first was \\'Paris,J\\'Taime\\', which I really enjoyed. The film was made up of several segments,each written and/or directed by a different director (most of which were French,but there is a very funny segment directed by Joel & Ethan Coen). Like \\'Paris\\', this one is also an anthology, directed by several different directors (Fatih Akin,Mira Nair,Natalie Portman,Shakher Kapur,etc.),and also like \\'Paris\\'deals with New Yorkers,and why they love the city they live in. It features a top notch cast,featuring the likes of Natalie Portman,Shia LaBeouf,Christina Ricci,Orlando Bloom,Ethan Hawki,and also features such seasoned veterans as James Caan,Cloris Leachman,Eli Wallach and Julie Christie. Some of the stories really fly,and others don\\'t (although I suppose it will depend on individual tastes---I won\\'t ruin it for anybody else by revealing which ones worked for me & which ones didn\\'t). Word is that the next entry in the series will be Shanghai, China (is Rome,Italy,Berlin,Germany or Athens,Greece out of the question?). Spoken mainly in English,but does have bits of Yiddish & Russian with English subtitles. Rated \\'R\\'by the MPAA for strong language & sexual content\"'],\n",

       "  '\"First of all, yes, animals have emotions. If you didn\\'t know that already, then I believe you are a moron. But let\\'s assume that none of us are morons. We all know that animals have emotions, and we now want to see how these emotions are manifest in nature, correct?<br /><br />What we get instead is a tedious and ridiculously simplistic documentary that attempts to show how animals are \\\\\"human\\\\\". The filmmakers search high & low for footage of animals engaged in human-like behaviour, and when it happens they say, \\\\\"That monkey is almost human!\\\\\" (that\\'s actually a direct quote).<br /><br />Everything is in human terms. They waste time theorizing about what makes dogs \\\\\"smile\\\\\", but not once do they mention what a wagging tail means. The arrogance of these researchers is disgusting. They even go so far as to show chimpanzees dressed in human clothing and wearing a cowboy hat.<br /><br />I had been expecting an insightful documentary of animals on their own terms. I wanted to learn how animals emote in their OWN languages. But instead, researchers keep falling back on pedantic, anthropomorphic observations and assumptions. Add a cheezy soundtrack and images of chimps \\\\\"celebrating Christmas\\\\\", and this was enough to turn my stomach.<br /><br />But it doesn\\'t end there. Half of this documentary is filmed not in the wild but in laboratories and experimental facilities. All the camera shots of chimps are through steel bars, and we see how these monkeys are crowded together in their sterile concrete cages. One particularly sobering moment happens near the beginning (though you have to be quick to notice it) where a captive monkey says in sign language, \\\\\"Want out. Hurry go.\\\\\"<br /><br />Obscure references are made to \\\\\"stress tests\\\\\" and psychological experiments which I shudder to imagine. Baby monkeys are separated from their mothers at birth and are given wireframe dolls in order to prove that baby monkeys crave a \\\\\"mother figure\\\\\". And after 40 years of experiments, the smug researchers pat themselves on the back for reaching their brilliant conclusion: monkeys have emotions.<br /><br />One chimp named \\\\\"Washoe\\\\\" has been in a concrete cage since 1966 for that purpose, and to this day she remains thus. We get a brief glimpse (again through bars) of her leaning against a concrete wall with a rather lackluster expression. Personally, I don\\'t need to see any further experimental data.

       "  '\"First things first, Edison Chen did a fantastic, believable job as a Cambodian hit-man, born and bred in the dumps and a gladiatorial ring, where he honed his craft of savage battery in order to survive, living on the mantra of kill or be killed. In a role that had little dialogue, or at least a few lines in Cambodian/Thai, his performance is compelling, probably what should have been in the Jet Li vehicle Danny the Dog, where a man is bred for the sole purpose of fighting, and on someone else\\'s leash.<br /><br />Like Danny the Dog, the much talked about bare knuckle fight sequences are not choreographed stylistically, but rather designed as normal, brutal fisticuffs, where everything goes. This probably brought a sense of realism and grit when you see the characters slug it out at each other\\'s throats, in defending their own lives while taking it away from others. It\\'s a grim, gritty and dark movie both literally and figuratively, and this sets it apart from the usual run off the mill cop thriller production.<br /><br />Edison plays a hired gun from Cambodia, who becomes a fugitive in Hong Kong, on the run from the cops as his pickup had gone awry. Leading the chase is the team led by Cheung Siu-Fai, who has to contend with maverick member Inspector Ti (Sam Lee), who\\'s inclusion and acceptance in the team had to do with the sins of his father. So begins a cat and mouse game in the dark shades and shadows of the seedier looking side of Hong Kong.<br /><br />The story itself works on multiple levels, especially in the character studies of the hit-man, and the cop. On opposite sides of the law, we see within each character not the black and white, but the shades of grey. With the hit-man, we see his caring side when he got hooked up and developed feelings of love for a girl (Pei Pei), bringing about a sense of maturity, tenderness, and revealing a heart of gold. The cop, with questionable tactics and attitudes, makes you wonder how one would buckle when willing to do anything it takes to get the job done. There are many interesting moments of moral questioning, on how anti-hero, despicable strategies are adopted. You\\'ll ask, what makes a man, and what makes a beast, and if we have the tendency to switch sides depending on circumstances - do we have that dark inner streak in all of us, transforming from man to dog, and dog to man? Dog Bite Dog grips you from the start and never lets go until the end, though there are points mid way through that seemed to drag, especially on its tender moments, and it suffered too from not knowing when to end. If I should pick a favourite scene, then it must be the one in the market food centre - extremely well controlled and delivered, a suspenseful edge of your seat moment. Listen out for the musical score too, and you\\'re not dreaming if you hear growls of dogs.<br /><br />Highly recommended, especially if you think that you\\'ve seen about almost everything from the cop thriller genre.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"The problem with the 1985 version of this movie is simple; Indiana Jones was so closely modeled after Alan Quartermain (or at least is an Alan Quartermain TYPE of character), that the \\'85 director made the mistake of plundering the IJ movies for dialog and story far too deeply. What you got as a finished product was a jumbled mess of the name Alan Quartermain, in an uneven hodge podge of a cheaply imitated IJ saga (with a touch of Austin Powers-esquire cheese here and there). <br /><br />It was labeled by many critics to have been a \\\\\"great parody,\\\\\" or \\\\\"unintentional comedy.\\\\\" Unintentional is the word. This movie was never intended to be humorous; witty, yes, but not humorous. Unfortunately, it\\'s witless rather than witty.<br /><br />With this new M4TV mini-series, you get much more story, character development of your lead, solid portrayals, and a fine, even, entertaining blend. This story is a bit long; much longer than its predecessors, but deservedly so as this version carries a real storyline and not just action and Eye Candy. While it features both action and Eye Candy, it also corrects the mistake made in the 1985 version by forgetting IJ all together and going back to the source materials for AQ, making for a fine, well - thought - out plot, and some nice complementing sub-plots. <br /><br />Now this attempt is not the all out action-extravaganza that is Indiana Jones. Nor is it a poor attempt to be so. This vehicle is plot and character driven and is a beautiful rendition of the AQ/KSM saga. Filmed on location in South Africa, the audience is granted beautiful (if desolate) vistas, SA aboriginal cultures, and some nice wildlife footage to blend smoothly with the performances and storyline here.<br /><br />Steve Boyum totally surprised me with this one, as I have never been one to subscribe to his vision. In fact, I have disliked most of his work as a director, until this attempt. I hope this is more a new vein of talent and less the fluke that it seems to be. <br /><br />This version rates a 9.8/10 on the \\\\\"TV\\\\\" scale from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.\"'],\n",

James Woods was great.<br /><br />Now, I\\'ll admit that I am at a disadvantage since I have not seen a few of the movies that this parodies unlike the first, where I had basically seen them all. But bad comedy is still bad comedy.<br /><br />Something that really hurt this movie was the timing, which ruined some of what might have been good jokes. Scenes and jokes drag out way to long.<br /><br />Also, the same jokes keep getting repeated again and again. For example, the talking bird. Ok it was funny the first and maybe even the second time. But it kept getting repeated to the point of annoying. The routine between the wheelchair guy and Hanson (Chris Elliott) was amusing at first but it kept getting repeated and ended up stupid and even tasteless.<br /><br />Some jokes even got repeated from the first movie. For example, the \\'creaming\\' I guess you would call it of Cindy (Anna Faris) was funny in \\\\\"Scary Movie\\\\\" because Cindy had been holding out on giving her boyfriend sex for so long, that essentially he had blue balls from hell and it was funny when he \\'creamed\\' her. But this time around it was out of place and not funny.<br /><br />The bathroom and sexual humor in general was more amusing and well timed the first time around.

Just as some of the finest films of the silent era were being made in every genre, sound was coming in and - while reaping great profits at the box office - was setting the art of film-making back about five years as the film industry struggled with the new technology.<br /><br />\\\\\"Show People\\\\\" is one of the great silent era comedies. The film shows that William Haines had comic skills beyond his usual formula of the obnoxious overconfident guy who turns everyone against him, learns his lesson, and then redeems himself by winning the football game, the polo game, etc. This movie is also exhibit A for illustrating that Marion Davies was no Susan Alexander Kane. She had excellent comic instincts and timing. This film starts out as the Beverly Hillbillies-like adventure of Peggy Pepper (Marion Davies) and her father, General Marmaduke Oldfish Pepper, fresh from the old South. General Pepper has decided that he will let some lucky movie studio executive hire his daughter as an actress. While at the studio commissary, the Peppers run into Billy Boone (William Haines), a slapstick comedian. He gets Peggy an acting job. She\\'s unhappy when she finds out it is slapstick, but she perseveres. Eventually she is discovered by a large studio and she and Billy part ways as she begins to take on dramatic roles. Soon the new-found fame goes to her head, and she is about to lose her public and gain a royal title when she decides to marry her new leading man, whom she doesn\\'t really love, unless fate somehow intervenes.<br /><br />One of the things MGM frequently does in its late silent-era films and in its early sound-era films is feature shots of how film-making was done at MGM circa 1930. This film is one of those, as we get Charlie Chaplin trying to get Peggy\\'s autograph, an abundance of cameos of MGM players during that era including director King Vidor himself, and even a cameo of Marion Davies as Peggy seeing Marion Davies as Marion Davies arriving at work on the lot. Peggy grimaces and mentions that she doesn\\'t care for her. Truly a delight from start to finish, this is a silent that is definitely worth your while. This is one of the films that I also recommend you use to introduce people to the art of silent cinema as it is very accessible.\"'],\n",

Inside, we meet The Collector, an elderly man who has apparently devoted his life to the study of the six known existing paints of an obscure Impressionist-era painter, Tonnerre. A narrator recites various epigrams about art and painting, and then engages in a dialogue with The Collector, who describes the paintings to us, shows them to us, tells us a little bit about the painter and the scandal that brought him down, and then tells us he\\'s going to show us something....<br /><br />As he walks through a doorway, we enter another world, or worlds, or perhaps to stretch to the limits, other possible worlds. The Collector shows us through his apparently limitless house, including a large yard full of trees with a hill; within these confines are the 6 paintings come to life, or half-way to life as he walks us through various tableaux and describes to us the possible meanings of each painting, of the work as a whole, of a whole secret history behind the paintings, the scandal, the people in the paintings, the novel that may have inspired the paintings. And so on, and so on. Every room, every description, leads us deeper into a labyrinth, and all the while The Collector and The Narrator engage in their separate monologues, very occasionally verging into dialogue, but mostly staying separate and different.<br /><br />I watched this a second time, so bizarre and powerful and indescribable it was, and so challenging to think or write about. If I have a guess as to what it all adds up to, it would be a sly satire of the whole nature of artistic interpretation.

It\\'s also nice not to have a wise cracking, headstrong love interest. Instead we have a gentle headstrong love interest, far more in keeping with Wodehouses\\' young aristocratic females.\"'],\n",

Well, if you regard it as an action movie, this view point could be quite true as the action part of this movive is not actually exciting. However, I think this is a psychological drama rather than an action one.<br /><br />The movie mainly told us about the inside of two snipers who definitely had different personalities and different experiences. Tomas Beccket , who was a veteran and had 74 confirmed kills, looked as if he was cold-hearted. However, after Beccket showed his day dream of Montana, we can clearly see his softness inside. It was the cruel war and his partners\\' sacrifice that made Beccket become so called cold-hearted.<br /><br />Millar, on the contrary, was a new comer, a green hand, and was even not qualified as a sniper. Billy Zane did quite well to show millar\\'s hesitation and fear when he first tried to \\\\\"put a bullet through one\\'s heart\\\\\"(as what Beccket said). What he thought about the actuall suicide mission was that it could be easily accomplished and then he could safely get back and receive the award.<br /><br />These two guys were quite different in their personalities and I think that the movie had successfully showed the difference and the impact they had to each other due to the difference in their personalities. These two snipers quarreled, suspected each other and finally come to an understanding by the communication and by what they had done to help even to save the other.<br /><br />Sniper isn\\'t a good action movie but a good psychological one.\"'],\n",

If he had, he could have called it The Razor\\'s Edge, since the Katha-Upanishad tells us, \\\\\"The sharp edge of a razor is difficult to pass over; thus the wise say the path to Salvation is hard.\\\\\" But Maugham decided to stick with the well-bred class, and so we have Darryl F. Zanuck\\'s version of Larry Darrell, recently returned from WWI, carefully groomed, well connected in society and determined to find himself by becoming a coal miner. <br /><br />Or, as Maugham tells us, \\\\\"This is the young man of whom I write. He is not famous. It may be that when at last his life comes to an end he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on this earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water. Yet it may be that the way of life he has chosen for himself may have an ever growing influence over his fellow men, so that, long after his death, perhaps, it will be realized that lived in this age a very remarkable creature.\\\\\" <br /><br />The Razor\\'s Edge has all of Zanuck\\'s cultural taste that money could buy. It\\'s so earnest, so sincere...so self-important. As Larry goes about his search for wisdom, working in mines, on merchant ships, climbing a Himalayan mountain to learn from an ancient wise man, we have his selfish girl friend, Isabel, played by Gene Tierney, his tragic childhood chum played by Anne Baxter, the girlfriend\\'s snobbish and impeccably clad uncle played by Clifton Webb, and Willie Maugham himself, played by Herbert Marshall, taking notes. The movie is so insufferably smug about goodness that the only thing that perks it up a bit is Clifton Webb as Elliot Templeton. \\\\\"If I live to be a hundred I shall never understand how any young man can come to Paris without evening clothes.\\\\\" Webb has some good lines, but we wind up appreciating Clifton Webb, not Elliot Templeton. <br /><br />Zanuck wanted a prestige hit for Twentieth Century when he bought the rights to Maugham\\'s novel. He waited a year until Tyrone Power was released from military service. He made sure there were well-dressed extras by the dozens, a score that sounds as if it were meant for a cathedral and he even wrote some of the scenes himself. The effort is as self-conscious as a fat man wearing a rented tux. Despite Hollywood\\'s view of things in The Razor\\'s Edge, I can tell you that for most people hard work doesn\\'t bring enlightenment, just weariness and low pay. <br /><br />After nearly two-and-a-half hours, we last see Larry carrying his duffle bag on board a tramp steamer in a gale. He\\'s going to work his way back to America from Europe with a contented smile on his face. \\\\\"My dear,\\\\\" Somerset Maugham says to Isabel at the same time in an elaborately decorated parlor, \\\\\"Larry has found what we all want and what very few of us ever get. I don\\'t think anyone can fail to be better, and nobler, kinder for knowing him. You see, my dear, goodness is after all the greatest force in the world...and he\\'s got it!\\\\\" Larry and the audience both need a healthy dose of Dramamine. <br /><br />Maugham, lest we forget, was a fine writer of plays, novels, essays and short stories. To see how the movies could do him justice, watch the way some of his short stories were brought to the screen in Encore, Trio and Quartet. And instead of wasting time with Larry Darrell, spend some time with Lawrence Durrell. The Alexandria Quartet is a good read.\"'],\n",

As an investment, this is indeed the best of the bunch if only for the fact that this is Streisand at her purest and most eager to impress. That she succeeds so brilliantly is a key component of her legend. Signed to a long-term contract with CBS to produce hour-long variety shows, an almost extinct format nowadays, Streisand was all of 22 in this CBS special first broadcast in April 1965. At that point of her career, her notoriety was limited to a handful of best-selling albums, a few dazzling TV appearances on variety and talk shows, and her successful Broadway run in \\\\\"Funny Girl\\\\\".<br /><br />Filmed in crisp black-and-white, the program is divided into three distinct parts.

And unlike so many other films that seem to lose their luster when finally viewed again, I found the visual images from the \\\\\"Pride of the Marines\\\\\" were as vivid and effective as I first remembered. What makes this movie so special, anyway?<br /><br />Everything. Based on the true story of Al Schmid and his fellow Marine machine gun crew\\'s ordeal at the Battle of the Tenaru River on Guadalcanal in November, 1942, the screenplay stays 95% true to the book upon which it was based, \\\\\"Al Schmid, Marine\\\\\" by Roger Butterfield, varying only enough to meet the time constrains of a motion picture. This is not a typical \\\\\"war movie\\\\\" where the action is central, and indeed the war scene is a brief 10 minutes or so in the middle of the film. But it is a memorable 10 minutes, filmed in the lowest light possible to depict a night battle, and is devoid of the mock heroics or falseness that usually plagues the genre. In a way probably ahead of its time, the natural drama of what happened there was more than sufficient to convey to the audience the stark, ugly, brutal nature of battle, and probably shocked audiences when it was seen right after the war. This film isn\\'t about \\\\\"glorifying\\\\\" war; I can\\'t imagine anyone seeing that battle scene and WANTING to enlist in the service. Not right away, anyway.<br /><br />What this film really concerns is the aftermath of battle, and how damaged men can learn to re-claim their lives. There\\'s an excellent hospital scene where a dozen men discuss this, and I feel that\\'s another reason why the film was so so well received--it was exceptionally well-written. There\\'s a \\\\\"dream\\\\\" sequence done in inverse (negative film) that seems almost experimental, and the acting is strong, too, led by John Garfield. Garfield was perfect for the role because his natural temperament and Schmid\\'s were nearly the same, and Garfield met Schmid and even lived with him for a while to learn as much as he could about the man and his role.

These four stories are brought to you in a wonderfully Gothic atmosphere, and with one of the finest ensemble casts imaginable. Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee (Cushing and Lee are two of my favorite actors ever), as well as Denholm Elliott and the ravishing Ingrid Pitt star in this film - so which true Horror fan could possibly afford to miss it? No one, of course, and the film has much more to offer than just a great cast. \\\\\"The House That Dripped Blood\\\\\" revolves around an eerie rural mansion, in which strange things are happening. In four parts, the film tells the tales of four different heirs.<br /><br />The first tale, \\\\\"Method For Murder\\\\\", tells the story of Horror novelist Charles Hyller (Denholm Elliott), who moves into the House with his wife. After moving in, the writer suddenly feels haunted by a maniac of his own creation... The first segment is a great kickoff to the film. The story is creepy and macabre throughout and the performances are entirelly very good.<br /><br />In the second story, \\\\\"Waxworks\\\\\", retired businessman Phillip Grayson (Peter Cushing) moves into the house, and suddenly feels drawn to a mysterious Wax Museum in the nearby town... The great Peter Cushing once again delivers a sublime performance in this, and the rest of the performances are also very good. The tale is delightfully weird, and the second-best of the film, after the third.<br /><br />The third tale, \\\\\"Sweets To The Sweet\\\\\" is by far the creepiest and most brilliant of the four. John Reed (Christopher Lee) moves in with his little daughter. The private teacher and nanny Mrs. Norton, whom Mr. Reed has employed to instruct his daughter, is appalled about her employer\\'s strictness towards his daughter, and is eager to find out what reason the overprotective father\\'s views on upbringing may have... This best segment maintains a very creepy atmosphere and a genuinely scary plot. Christopher Lee is, as always, superb in his role. Nyree Dawn Porter is also very good as the nanny, and my special praise goes to then 11-year-old Chloe Franks. This ingenious segment alone makes the film a must-see for every true Horror-fan.<br /><br />In the fourth segment, Horror-actor Paul Henderson (Jon Pertwee) moves into the house with his sexy mistress/co-star Carla (Ingrid Pitt). This fourth story is satire, more than it is actually Horror. It is a highly amusing satire, however, and there are many allusions to other Horror films. At one point Henderson indirectly refers to Christopher Lee, who stars in the previous, third segment...<br /><br />All four segments have a delightfully macabre sense of humor and a great atmosphere. As stated above, the third segment is by far the creepiest and greatest, but the other three are also atmospheric and often macabrely humorous Horror tales that every Horror lover should appreciate. An igenious atmosphere, a macabre sense of humor, genuine eerieness and a brilliant cast make this one a must-see. In Short: \\\\\"The House That Dripped Blood\\\\\" is an excellent Horror-omnibus that no lover of British Horror could possibly afford to miss. Highly Recommended!\"'],\n",

I\\'m really surprised that a horror movie about dentistry didn\\'t turn up until 1996, as going to the dentist is almost a primal fear - it\\'s running away from a tiger for the modern world. Dentistry doesn\\'t frighten me, but surprisingly; I would appear to be in the minority. The plot follows perfectionist dentist Dr Feinstone. He has a nice house, a successful career and a beautiful wife - pretty much everything most people want. However, his life takes a turn for the worse when he discovers his wife\\'s affair with the pool cleaner. And his life isn\\'t the only one; as it\\'s his patients who feel the full brunt of his anger...<br /><br />When it comes to scaring the audience, this movie really makes itself. However, credit has to go to the director for extracting the full quota of scares from the central theme. The fact that he does a good job is summed up by the fact that I\\'m not squeamish about going to the dentist - yet one particular scene actually made me cover my eyes! The film follows the standard man going insane plot outline, only with The Dentist you always get the impression that there\\'s more to the film than what we\\'re seeing. It isn\\'t very often that a gore film can impress on a substance level - and while this won\\'t be winning any awards, the parody on the upper class is nicely tied into the plot. The acting, while B-class, is actually quite impressive; with Corbin Bernsen taking the lead role and doing a good job of convincing the audience that he really is a man on the edge. I should thank Brian Yuzna for casting Ken Foree in the movie. The Dawn of the Dead star doesn\\'t get enough work, and I really love seeing him in films. The rest of the cast doesn\\'t massively impress, but all do their jobs well enough. Overall, The Dentist offers a refreshing change for nineties slasher movies. The gore scenes are sure to please horror fans, and I don\\'t hesitate to recommend this film.\"'],\n",

Sadly, the resulting film - which the ads claimed was \\'nine times more suspenseful\\' than \\\\\"Bird\\\\\" - is a disappointing follow-up, impeccably photographed and stylishly executed, but too plodding and aimless for general consumption.<br /><br />Malden and Franciscus are eminently watchable in sympathetic roles, and cinematographer Enrico Menczer (THE DEAD ARE ALIVE) uses the wide Cromoscope frame to convey the hi-tech world in which Argento\\'s dark-hearted scenario unfolds, but the subplot involving Euro starlet Catherine Spaak (THE LIBERTINE) as Franciscus\\' romantic interest amounts to little more than unnecessary padding. Highlights include an unforgettable encounter with the black-gloved assassin in a crowded railway station (edited with sleek assurance by cult movie stalwart Franco Fraticelli), and a nocturnal episode in which Malden and Franciscus seek an important clue inside a mouldering tomb and fall prey to the killer\\'s devious machinations.

Unfortunately what it got in 1975 was Doc Savage, The Man of Bronze. Perhaps the best that can be said of legendary producer George Pal\\'s final film is that his often beautifully designed but sadly flat adaptation of Kenneth Robeson\\'s pulp-paperback novels probably had George Lucas and Phil Kaufman leaving the theatre and saying to each other \\\\\"We can do better than that,\\\\\" and adding a bullwhip, a battered Fedora and some much needed character flaws to the mix.<br /><br />A big part of the problem is that Doc Savage is in many ways even harder to write for than Superman \\x96 explorer, adventurer, philanthropist, a scientific and intellectual genius in the bronzed bleach-blonde bulletproof muscle-bound body of a Greek God (or rather the form of TV\\'s Tarzan, Ron Ely, a rather dull Charlton Heston clone here), there\\'s simply nothing he can\\'t do and, more damagingly, nothing that can harm him. The man is the virtual incarnation of Hitler\\'s Aryan ubermensch (no surprise that the DVD is only available in Germany!), albeit with all-American values. And just in case there should ever be anything he\\'s overlooked (not that there ever is) he has not one but five sidekicks in his entourage, the (less than) Fabulous Five. A chemist, an electrician and even an archaeologist I can accept, and at a stretch I could possibly even go as far as to see the possible need for a construction engineer, but what kind of hero takes a criminal lawyer with him on his adventures? In reality Doc\\'s brain trust were probably added because with the hero so tiresomely invulnerable and practically perfect in every way \\x96 even Kryptonite wouldn\\'t put a dent in him - there needed to be someone at risk in the stories, though with the exception of Paul Gleason they\\'re all so horribly badly cast and overplayed (as are most parts in the film) you\\'d happily kill them all off during the opening titles. The villains fare no better, with Paul Wexler exuding all the menace of a geography teacher as Captain Seas, Scott Walker (no, a different one) delivering one of cinema\\'s worst accents (is it meant to be Scottish, Irish, Welsh, Greek, Pakistani or some nationality no-one has ever heard of?) while Robyn Hilton\\'s Marilyn Monroe-ish dumb blonde moll gives Paris (no relation) a run for her money in the untalented bimbo stakes.<br /><br />Even with those drawbacks, this should have been much better than it is considering the various ingredients \\x96 lost tribes, a pool of gold, a dogfight with a biplane and a deadly poison that comes alive, all wrapped up in a quest to discover why Doc\\'s father was murdered. Unfortunately it\\'s a question of tone: in the 60s and 70s pulp superheroes weren\\'t brooding figures prone to state-of-the-art action scenes and special effects but were treated as somewhat comical figures of low-budget camp fun with action scenes quickly knocked off on the cheap almost as an afterthought, the films aimed purely at the matinée market: you know, for kids. There have long been rumours that the original cut was more straight-faced \\x96 and certainly much of the camp value has been added in post-production, be it the Colgate twinkle in Doc\\'s eye, the comical captions identifying various fighting styles in the final dust-up with Captain Seas or Don Black\\'s gung-ho lyrics to John Philip Sousa\\'s patriotic marches \\x96 but plenty was in the film to begin with. After all, it\\'s hard to see how one of the villain\\'s underlings making phone calls from a giant rocking crib was ever intended as anything other than a joke that falls flat, while Doc\\'s explanation to Pamela Hensley of why he never dates girls could be a scene written for Adam West\\'s Batman. Instead, the funniest moments are usually purely unintentional, such as Doc displaying his sixth sense by, er, bobbing his Adam\\'s apple.<br /><br />Perhaps an even bigger problem is that, while promising on paper, the action is handled in an almost relentlessly mundane fashion, be it chasing a native assassin on the rooftops of New York skyscrapers or escaping from a yacht full of bad guys. Even the winning notion of animated glowing green snakes swirling through the air as they poison their victims fails to raise any enthusiasm from director Michael Anderson: having demonstrated their own invulnerability a couple of scenes earlier, Doc manages to dispatch them with no more than a chair and an electric fan by simply pulling the curtains on them.<br /><br />Still, aside from Doc\\'s various vehicles all stamped with his logo and looking more moulded plastic than bronze, the production design is often rather handsome even if it is very obviously L.A. standing in for New York while Fred Koenekamp\\'s cinematography ensures the film often looks good despite the low budget. And it\\'s good to see a superhero movie that doesn\\'t spend most of its running time on an origin story, though one is left with the suspicion that Doc sprang fully formed from the loins of Zeus himself.<br /><br />It\\'s a film I\\'d really like to like more, but it just feels like 100 minutes of lost opportunities. No wonder Doc Savage, The Arch Enemy of Evil, the sequel so optimistically promised in the end credits, never happened.\"'],\n",

Parents who have had to sit through \\\\\"The Jungle Book 2\\\\\" or even a Pokemon movie will surely appreciate this one.<br /><br />The film is one of few to attempt at an original story; previous feature films were merely re tellings of existing stories. Films such as \\\\\"Toy Story\\\\\", \\\\\"Finding Nemo\\\\\", and \\\\\"Monsters Inc.\\\\\" all do the same, but it must be noted that all were made by Pixar and only distributed by Disney. Recent films from the Disney Studios are mostly released direct to video, and are sequels to an existing successful film. The quality of those films is given way to the profitability. A new era started with \\\\\"Atlantis\\\\\" following it were \\\\\"Mulan\\\\\", \\\\\"Lilo & Stitch\\\\\", and most recently \\\\\"Open Range\\\\\". The writers have created all original story lines instead of the fairy tales of the past.<br /><br />A good portion of the movie is devoted to the quest to find Atlantis, a task that has captured the imagination of many for hundreds of years. Including that of young Milo Thatch, voiced by Michael J. Fox. Milo is employed by a museum in Washington D.C.. His grandfather was a renowned archaeologist, who had devoted his life to discovering Atlantis. This was seen as a waste by his peers, and they wish Milo to not follow in his footsteps. After failing to convince the museum board of directors to sponsor his expedition, Milo comes home to find a woman in his darkened apartment. She takes him to her employer, a Mr. Whitmore. Whitmore was a close friend of Milo\\'s grandfather, and wishes to send Milo with a team to locate Atlantis. Mr. Whitmore is very wealth and has paid for the best of everything. The crew that is to accompany him is the same as his grandfathers. The journey is filled with many great obstacles to overcome and is great fun to watch. The viewer finds themselves caught up in if they will reach Atlantis. The plot takes an unexpected turn after the discovery Atlantis, not just the discovery of people. It is enough to keep the interest of the older audience.<br /><br />The animators have done a wonderful job in then depth of the animation. The movie is very successful in blending traditional animation with Computer Generated Images. A feat not easily achieved, most audiences are quick to notice the difference in the two. The characters are believably human. There are some nice chase type scenes, with lots of action going on. A few lulls are filled with jokes that the children just may not get.<br /><br />The creativity of the writers really shines through. The culture of Atlantis is richly developed, including an entire language. The film uses references to Atlantis from historical sources, such as Plato. The disappearance of Atlantis from the world is explained. Believable, if by a younger audience, that magic really does exist. The powers of the people of Atlantis are not exactly presented as magic, but can best be described in this way.<br /><br />Although set in 1914 the level of technology used is unrealistic. The voyage is in a submarine very reminiscent of Captain Nemo\\'s nautilus, complete with sub pods that fire torpedoes. The giant diggers are driven by steam boilers so they did try for some era technology. The female characters are empowered in a way that women of the age would not have been, even holding roles in leadership. This is not a bad thing. It gives a good role model for my daughter to look to, rather than an all male cast.<br /><br />One reason this film is a favorite of mine over other Disney films is that there is not one single song, ever. A tradition that began with the first feature film, \\\\\"Snow White\\\\\", and carried on through to \\\\\"The Lion King\\\\\", almost every Disney film is full of upbeat songs. This is great and all, what would the Seven Dwarfs be without \\\\\"Hi HO!\\\\\"? After the millionth time through it\\'d almost be better without, but this one spares the parent. Not once does every single person on the screen suddenly know the words to a song that no one has ever heard before and break out in song. I for one am grateful.<br /><br />The storyline and depth of animation is sure to keep the attention of both parent and child alike.

Even Harvey Keitel appears to be out of his element, and lacks his usual impeccable clarity, direction and intensity. To make matters worse, his character\\'s name is \\'Che\\', and we are only told (directly, by the narrator) well into the film that he is not \\'that\\' Che, just a guy named Che. The family relationships remain unclear until the end of the film, and once defined, the family is divided - the younger generation off to America. So cliché. Other reviews discuss how the movie depicts the impact of the revolution on a boy\\'s family; however the political stance of the director is murky at best, and we are never quite sure who is responsible for what bloodshed. So they lost their property (acquired by gambling profits) - so what? Refusing to take a political stand, when making a movie about the Cuban revolution, is an odd and cowardly choice. Not to mention the movie was in English! Why are all these Cubans speaking English? No wonder they did not get permission to film in Cuba. And if family life is most important to look at here, it would be great if we could figure out who is who - we are \\'introduced\\' to them all in the beginning - a cheap way out of making the relationships clear throughout the film! The acting was mostly shallow, wooden, and unbelievable, timing was off all around. The \\'special\\' visual effects were confusing and distracting.

It is an incredible story of a strong and devoted people.<br /><br />As a member of the church, the single most disturbing aspect of the film (most of the historical inaccuracies did not bother me much) was the portrayal of Brigham Young as one that had \\\\\"knowingly deceived\\\\\" church members into believing he had been called to be Joseph\\'s successor as the prophet. Although I understand the dramatic reasons for this plot line, it creates the impression that his doubts in this regard are historical fact, when in reality, both Brigham and the bulk of the church members understood and believed firmly that he had been called to lead the church. Brigham did not knowingly deceive the saints; rather he led them confidently by inspiration. The point is important for Mormons because on it hinges an important aspect of our faith: that God truly speaks to prophets today, and that Brigham Young, like Joseph Smith, was an inspired prophet of God.<br /><br />Whether or not you believe this statement or not, just know that the film does not accurately portray what Brigham himself believed.\"'],\n",

American dancing star & heartthrob Jerry Halliday (Astaire), on a European tour & weary of the screaming female crowds generated by the lurid propaganda of his manager (Burns), is unwittingly caught up in the marriage prospects of frustrated heiress Lady Alice Marshmorton (Fontaine). The tale is complicated by a betting pool among the Marshmorton servants that is run by (and rigged for) head butler Keggs (Gardiner), who\\'s betting on Lady Alice\\'s cousin Reggie (Noble), the favorite of Alice\\'s stuffy, domineering aunt (Collier). The story would have been much better as a half-hour TV episode. The usual Wodehouse plot devices of mistaken identity and jumps to wrong conclusions wear thin in a full-length film. Both Alice & Jerry appear impossibly (and annoyingly) clueless by the second half of the film. The amusement park interlude & the climax in the castle are too long & begin to drag. Fontaine is too beautiful, too dignified & too quiet to be a ditzy blonde, no matter how aristocratic, while young footman Albert (Watson) is painfully awful. But while \\\\\"Damsel\\\\\" is a pretty diminutive vehicle for so much talent, the talent doesn\\'t let us down. Astaire\\'s romantic comedy skill is no less enjoyable here than in any of his films with Ginger Rogers and his dance scenes, both solo & with Burns & Allen, are up to par, though his one dance with novice hoofer Joan is necessarily tame. Gracie nearly steals the whole show as George\\'s bubbly secretary who is at once airheaded, conniving & coolly self-confident. Her scene with solid character actor Gardiner as the devious snob Keggs is a one-of-a-kind classic. This & Astaire\\'s priceless scene with the madrigal singers give \\\\\"Damsel\\\\\" a delightful color of naive but noble-spirited Americans mixing with noble but dull-spirited Englishmen. Gershwin is at the top of his game with \\\\\"Nice Work if You Can Get it\\\\\" & \\\\\"Stiff Upper Lip,\\\\\" which carry the film through its weak points. And is there another film where madrigals get a Gershwin swing treatment? \\\\\"Damsel\\\\\" is more than a piece of trivia for those who might want to see Astaire without Rogers or Fontaine before she was a real star.

Then picture a dystopian, science fiction thriller, such as Steven Spielberg\\'s Minority Report or Richard Linklater\\'s A Scanner Darkly. An amalgamation of the above would be a suitable way of describing visionary french director Christian Volckman\\'s bleak and atmospheric take on the future in his feature film debut. But although Volckman\\'s work does unquestionably take reference from the aforementioned films and those similar to them, such a simplistic hybrid does not do Renaissance, Volckman\\'s end result, justice - the film itself is a far more complex piece of work than that.<br /><br />Genre hybridity is usually a hit and miss affair, especially in a contemporary context, with the well of individuality appearing to be increasingly exhausted. As such, Renaissance is laudable as a cinematic experiment at the very least, with its unique interspersing of the gritty nihilism of the neo-noir detective thriller and the fantastic allegorical terror of the dystopian sci-fi drama, which serve to compliment each other\\'s storytelling conventions in a strangely fitting fashion. The screenplay is a clever and intriguing one (although one gets the sense that many of the lines in the script would have been much more effective in their original french than the English translation - the film\\'s title also becomes far more poignant) managing to stay one step ahead of its audience all the way through. Though many elements of the plot will seem quite familiar to those who frequent such science fiction thrillers, the script throws unexpected twists and turns in at exactly the right moment to keep the viewer on their toes, making for a truly compelling work.<br /><br />Volckman\\'s film truly excels in its visual component, and the stunning black and white animation is easily the film\\'s highlight - superbly moody and stylish, it goes to show what tremendous aesthetic effect the simple use of two shades can have. With tremendous detail paid to the composition and look of each shot, and superb use of very noir shadows and intriguing angles to accentuate the emotional tension of the scene, the film appears straight out of a Frank Miller comic, but with a twist, the end result being consistently visually sumptuous. <br /><br />The film\\'s English rendition is also given added credence by its very fitting array of voice casting. The gruff voice of Daniel Craig is an absolutely perfect piece of casting for grim, stoic policeman Karas, and Catherine McCormack is a strong presence as the mysterious woman whose sister\\'s disappearance he is investigating. Despite a wavering English accent, Romola Garai does great work as the frantic sister in question, and Jonathan Pryce is suitably menacing as the shady head of ominous mega-corporation Avalon. Ian Holm\\'s reedy voice is also a strong choice as a mysterious scientist, and Holm makes a powerful impression in his brief scenes.<br /><br />All together, Renaissance boasts a visually stunning, unique and compelling futuristic thriller, just as intelligent as it is entertaining. Though the plot may seem familiar to those who frequent such fare and the occasional weak line may inhibit the film from being the moody masterpiece it set out to be, the superb animation in itself easily carries the film through its occasional qualms. For fans of either of the film\\'s intertwined genres or the gritty graphic novels of Frank Miller, or those willing to appreciate a capably crafted, slightly less conventional take on the futuristic thriller, the film is without question worth a watch.<br /><br />-8/10\"'],\n",

Dr. Rukh (Karloff) demonstrates to a couple of eminent colleagues (among them Bela Lugosi as Dr. Benet) how he managed to capture extraterrestrial rays inside a self-manufactured device. The scientists are sincerely impressed with his work and invite Rukh and his lovely wife Diane along for an expedition in the heart of Africa. There Dr. Rukh isolates himself from the group, discovers the essential element \\\\\"Radium X\\\\\" to complete his medical ray and goes completely bonkers after being overexposed to the meteorite himself. The third and final act is obviously the best and most horrific one, as it revolves on a good old fashioned killing spree with ingenious gimmicks (melting statues) and a surprising climax. Karloff glows in the dark and, convinced the others are out to steal his discovery and even his life, he intends to eliminate them using his deadly touch. The narrative structure of \\\\\"The Invisible Ray\\\\\" sounds rather complicated, but the film is easy to follow and entertaining. The story is rather far-fetched but nevertheless compelling and director Lambert Hillyer provides several moments of sheer suspense. Boris Karloff is truly fantastic and so is Lugosi, even though he deserved to have a little more screen time. Their scenes together are the highlights of the film, along with the funky images of the glowing Boris.\"'],\n",

       "  '\"Taiwanese director Ang Lee, whose previous films include \\'Sense and Sensibility\\' and \\'The Ice Storm\\', turned to the American Civil War for his latest feature. Based on a novel by Daniel Woodrell, it follows the exploits of a group of Southern guerrillas, known as bushwhackers, as they fight their Northern equivalents, the jayhawkers in the backwater of Missouri.<br /><br />As one might expect, there is plenty of visceral action, but the focus is on the tension that the war put on the young men who fought it - many of whom were fighting against their former neighbours and even family. Jake Roedel (Tobey Maguire) is such a man, or rather, boy, as he is only seventeen when the war reaches Missouri. He is the son of a German immigrant, but instead of following his countrymen and becoming a Unionist, he joins his lifelong friend Jack Bull Chiles (Skeet Ulrich) and rides with the bushwhackers. Despite a lack of acceptance because of his ancestry and an unwillingness to participate in the murder of unarmed Union men, he remains loyal to the cause. So does his friend Daniel Holt (Jeffrey Wright), a black slave freed by another bushwhacker and so fighting for the South.<br /><br />Lee handles the subject with aplomb, never rushing the deep introspection that the plot demands in favour of action and this lends the film a sense of the reality of war - long periods of boredom and waiting interposed with occasional flashes of intensely terrifying fighting. The action is unglamorised and admirably candid, recognising that both sides committed a great number of atrocities.<br /><br />The performances are superb, with Maguire and Wright both courageous and dignified. Up-and-coming Irish actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers is particularly chilling as a cold-blooded killer, while Skeet Ulrich is enjoyably suave and arrogant. Lee never flinches from the reality of war, but his actors do an admirable job of showing the good that comes from it - the growth of friendship, the demonstration of courage and, on a wider scale, the emancipation of oppressed peoples. Ride With the Devil is a beautiful and deeply compassionate film that regularly shocks but always moves the audience.\"'],\n",

Stating he was ordered to defect, he sadly learns his commanding officer has been killed and has no evidence or proof of his innocence. He is convicted and sentenced to hang. However, his conviction is doubted by Capt. Young (Bradford Dillman), his prosecutor. Convincing commanding Gen.

       "  '\"Here\\'s my first David Mamet directed film. Fitting, since it was his first, as well. <br /><br />The story here is uneven and it moves along like any con movie, from the little cons to the big cons to the all-encompassing con. It\\'s like \\\\\"The Grifters,\\\\\" but without that film\\'s level of acting. (In that film, John Cusack was sort of bland but that was the nature of his character.) The acting here is very flat (I sometimes wondered if the bland acting by Crouse was supposed to be some sort of attack on psychoanalysis). At least in the beginning. It never gets really good, but it evolves beyond painfully stiff line reading after about ten minutes. Early in the film, some of Lindsay Crouse\\'s lines -- the way she reads them -- sound as if they\\'re inner monologue or narration, which they aren\\'t. With the arrival of Mantegna things pick up.<br /><br />The dialogue here isn\\'t as fun as it should be. I was expecting crackerjack ring-a-ding-ding lines that roll off the tongue, but these ones don\\'t. It all sounds very read, rather than spoken. Maybe Mamet evolved after this film and loosened up, but if not, then maybe he should let others direct his words. He\\'s far too precious with them here and as a result, they lose their rhythmic, jazzy quality. What\\'s more strange is that other than this, the film doesn\\'t look or feel like a play. The camera is very cinematic. My only problem with \\\\\"Glengarry Glen Ross\\\\\" was that it looked too much like filmed theatre, but in that film the actors were not only accomplished, but relaxed and free. Everything flowed.<br /><br />I wouldn\\'t mind so much if it sounded like movie characters speaking movie lines -- or even play characters speaking play lines -- but here it sounds like movie (or even book) characters speaking play lines. It\\'s a weird jumble of theatre and film that just doesn\\'t work. That doesn\\'t mean the movie is bad -- it isn\\'t, it\\'s often extremely entertaining. The best chunk is in the middle.<br /><br />It\\'s standard con movie stuff: the new guy (in this case, girl) Margaret Ford (Lindsay Crouse) gets involved in the seedy con underworld. How she gets involved is: she\\'s a psychiatrist and one of her patients, Billy is a compulsive gambler. She wants to help him out with his gambling debt, so she walks into The House of Games, a dingy game room where con men work in a back room. I\\'ll admit the setup is pretty improbable. (Were they just expecting Crouse to come in? Were they expecting she\\'d write a cheque? Was Billy in on it? One of these questions is definitely answered by the end, however.)<br /><br />And from here the cons are start to roll out. I found the beginning ones -- the little learner ones -- to be the most fun. We\\'re getting a lesson in the art of the con as much as Crouse is. <br /><br />We see the ending coming, and then we didn\\'t see the second ending coming, and then the real ending I didn\\'t see coming but maybe you did. The ball just keeps bouncing back and forth and by the last scene in the movie we realize that the second Crouse walked into The House of Games she found her true calling.<br /><br />I\\'m going to forgive the annoying opening, the improbable bits and the strange line-reading because there are many good things here. If the first part of the movie seems stagy, stick with it. After the half-hour mark it does really get a momentum going. If you want a fun con movie, then here she is.

I mean, take \\\\\"A Chorus Line\\\\\", a stage play turned into film. I know it\\'s something we see a lot nowadays, but back then it was a little different, apparently; and this film has something special.<br /><br />Most of the musicals made movies today, take the chance the camera gives them for free, to create different sceneries and take the characters to different places; \\\\\"A Chorus Line\\\\\" was born on a theater stage as a play and it dies in the same place as a movie. Following a big audition held by recognized choreographer Zach (Michael Douglas), Richard Atenborough directs a big number of dancers as they try to get the job.<br /><br />Everything happens on the same day: the tension of not knowing, the stress of having to learn the numbers, the silent competition between the dancers\\x85And it all occurs on the stage, where Douglas puts each dancer on the spotlight and makes them talk about their personal life and their most horrible experiences. There are hundreds of dancers and they are all fantastic, but they list shortens as the hours go by.<br /><br />Like a movie I saw recently, \\\\\"A Prairie Home Companion\\\\\", the broadcast of a radio show, Atenborough here deals with the problem of continuity. On or behind the stage, things are going on, and time doesn\\'t seem to stop. Again, I don\\'t if Atenborough cut a lot to shoot this, but it sure doesn\\'t look like it; and anyway it\\'s a great directing and editing (John Bloom) work. But in that little stage, what you wonder is what to do with the camera\\x85With only one setting, Ronnie Taylor\\'s cinematography finds the way, making close-ups to certain characters, zooming in and out, showing the stage from different perspective and also giving us a beautiful view of New York.<br /><br />In one crucial moment, Douglas tells the ones that are left: \\\\\"Before we start eliminating: you\\'re all terrific and I\\'d like to hire you all; but I can\\'t\\\\\". This made me think about reality shows today, where the only thing that counts is the singing or dancing talent and where the jury always says that exact words to the contestants before some of them are leaving (even when they are not good). It\\'s hard, you must imagine; at least here, where all of them really are terrific.<br /><br />To tell some of the stories, the characters use songs and, in one second, the stage takes a new life and it literally is \\'a dream come true\\'. The music by Marvin Hamlisch and the lyrics by Edward Kleban make the theater to film transition without flaws, showing these dancers\\' feelings and letting them do those wonderful choreographies by Michael Bennett. The book in the theater also becomes a flawless and very short screenplay by Arnold Schulman; which is very touching at times. So if it\\'s not with a song it will be with a word; but in \\\\\"A Chorus Line\\\\\", it\\'s impossible not to be moved.<br /><br />During one of the rehearsal breaks in the audition, Cassie, a special dancer played by Alyson Reed, takes the stage to convince Douglas character that she can do it. The words \\\\\"let me dance for you\\\\\" never sounded more honest and more beautifully put in music and lyrics.\"'],\n",

In this film the viewer is allowed to witness the gradual but nearly complete implosion of a family by a much used but, here, very sensible manipulation of the flashback/flash forward technique of storytelling. By repeatedly offering the differing vantages of each of the characters about the central incidents that drive this rather harrowing tale, we see all the motivations of the players in this case of a robbery gone very wrong. <br /><br />Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a wealthy executive, married to an emotionally needy Gina (Marisa Tomei), and addicted to an expensive drug habit. His life is beginning to crumble and he needs money. Andy\\'s ne\\'re-do well younger brother Hank (Ethan Hawke) is a life in ruins - he is divorced from his shrewish wife Martha (Amy Ryan), is behind in alimony and child support, and has borrowed all he can from his friends, and he needs money.

Andy advances Hank some cash and wrangles an agreement that Hank will do the actual robbery, but though Hank agrees to the \\'fail-safe\\' plan, he hires a friend to take on the actual job while Hank plans to be the driver of the getaway car. The robbery is horribly botched when Nanette, filing in for the regular clerk, shoots the robber and is herself shot in the mess. The disaster unveils many secrets about the fragile relationships of the family and when Nanette dies, Charles and Andy and Hank (and their respective partners) are driven to disastrous ends with surprises at every turn. <br /><br />Each of the actors in this strong but emotionally acrid film gives superb performances, and while we have come to expect that from Hoffman, Hawke, Tomei, Finney, Ryan, and Harris, it is the wise hand of direction from Sidney Lumet that make this film so unforgettably powerful.

Revenge, retribution, manipulation. Marty\\'s usual laying on of the Karo syrup. But unfortunately somewhere in Universal\\'s high-rise a memorandum came down: everyone ham it up.<br /><br />Nolte only speaks with eyebrows raised, Lange bitches her way through cigarettes, Lewis \\\\\"Ohmagod\\'s!\\\\\" her way though her scenes, and Bobby D...well, he\\'s on a whole other magic carpet. Affecting some sort of Cajun/Huckleberry Hound accent hybrid, he chomps fat cigars and cackles at random atrocities such as \\\\\"Problem Child\\\\\". And I want you to imagine the accent mentioned above. Now imagine it spouting brain-clanging religious rhetoric at top volume like he swallowed six bibles, and you have De Niro\\'s schtick here. Most distracting of all, though, is his most OVERDONE use of the \\\\\"De Niro face\\\\\" he\\'s so lampooned for. Eyes squinting, forehead crinkled, lips curled. Crimany, Bob, you looked like Plastic Man.<br /><br />The story apparently began off-screen 14 years earlier, when Nolte was unable to spare De Niro time in the bighouse for various assaults. Upon release, he feels Nolte\\'s misrep of him back then warrants the terrorizing of he and his kin. And we\\'re supposed to give De Niro\\'s character a slight pass because Nolte withheld information that might\\'ve shortened his sentence. De Niro being one of these criminals who, despite being guilty of unspeakable acts, feels his lack of freedom justifies continuing such acts on the outside. Mmm-kay.<br /><br />He goes after Notle\\'s near-mistress (in a scene some may want to turn away from), his wife, his daughter, the family dog, ya know. Which is one of the shortcomings of Wesley Strick\\'s screenplay: utter predictability. As each of De Niro\\'s harassments becomes more gruesome, you can pretty much call the rest of the action before it happens. Strick isn\\'t to be totally discredited, as he manages a few compelling dialogue-driven moments (De Niro and Lewis\\' seedy exchange in an empty theater is the film\\'s best scene), but mostly it\\'s all over-cranked. Scorsese\\'s cartoonish photographic approach comes off as forced, not to mention the HORRIBLY outdated re-worked Bernard Hermann score (I kept waiting for the Wolf Man to show up with a genetically enlarged tarantula).<br /><br />Thus we arrive at the comedic portion of the flick. Unintentionally comedic, that is. You know those scenes where something graphically horrific is happening, but you can\\'t help but snicker out of sight of others? You\\'ll do it here. Nolte and Lange squawking about infidelity, De Niro\\'s thumb-flirting, he cross-dressing, and a kitchen slip on a certain substance that has to be seen to believed. And Bob\\'s infernal, incessant, CONSTANT, mind-damaging, no-end-in sight blowhard ramblings of all the \\\\\"philosophy\\\\\" he disovered in prison. I wanted him killed to shut him up more than to save this annoying family.<br /><br />I always hate to borrow thoughts from other reviewers, but here it\\'s necessary. This really *is* Scorsese\\'s version of Freddy Krueger. The manner in which De Niro relishes, speaks, stalks, withstands pain, right down to his one-liners, is vintage Freddy. Upon being scalded by a pot of thrown water: \\\\\"You trying\\' to offer sumpin\\' hot?\\\\\" Please. And that\\'s just one example.<br /><br />Unless you were a fan of the original 1962 flick and want a thrill out of seeing Balsam, Peck, and Mitchum nearly 30 years later (or want a serious head-shaking film experience), avoid a trip to the Cape.\"'],\n",

Alexander turns in an exceptional performance as Albert, a performance in strong contrast to his better-known persona from a certain TV series. The remainder of the cast are entertaining and convincing in their roles (Chynna Phillips is perhaps the only one who does not look her part, supposedly a naive and innocent schoolgirl).<br /><br />But best of all, the musical numbers familiar from the stage show are all preserved in this movie and performed as stage musical songs should be (allowing for the absence of a stage).<br /><br />So, if you know the musical (and few do not), then check out this telemovie.

A civil war movie is not the typical movie I watch. Luckily though, I had a good feeling about this director. This movie was wonderfully written. The dialogue is in the old southern style, yet doesn\\'t sound cornily out of place and outdated. The spectacular acting helped that aspect of the movie. Toby Maguire was awesome. I thought he was good (but nothing special) in Pleasantville, but here he shines. I have always thought of Skeet Ulrich as a good actor (but nothing special), but here he is excellent as well. The big shocker for me was Jewel. She was amazingly good. Jeffrey Wright, who I had never heard of before, is also excellent in this movie. It seems to me that great acting and great writing and directing go hand in hand. A movie with bad writing makes the actors look bad and visa versa. This movie had the perfect combination. The actors look brilliant and the character development is spectacular. This movie keeps you wishing and hoping good things for some and bad things for others. It lets you really get to know the characters, which are all very dynamic and interesting. The plot is complex, and keeps you on the edge of your seat, guessing, and ready for anything at any time. Literally dozens of times I was sure someone was going to get killed on silent parts in the movie that were \\\\\"too quiet\\\\\" (brilliant directing). This was also a beautifully shot movie. The scenery was not breath taking (It\\'s in Missouri and Kansas for goodness sakez) but there was clearly much attention put into picking great nature settings. Has that rough and rugged feel, but keeps an elegance, which is very pleasant on the eyes. The movie was deep. It told a story and in doing so made you think. It had layers underneath that exterior civil war story. Specifically, it focused on two characters that were not quite sure what they were fighting for. There were many more deep issues dealt with in this movie, too many to pick out. It was like a beautifully written short story, filled with symbolism and artistic extras that leaves you thinking during and after the story is done. If you like great acting, writing, lots of action, and some of the best directing ever, see this movie! Take a chance on it.\"'],\n",

In a \\\\\"light\\\\\" way, like Tomas; in a \\\\\"heavy\\\\\" way like Tereza; or should we find ways not to face that question, like Sabina? How much is fidelity important in a relationship? How much of the professional life can be mutilated for the sake of our loved ones? How much do we have to be involved in the political life and the social issues of our Country?<br /><br />Unfortunately, I haven\\'t read Kundera\\'s novel but after having being let down by the movie I certainly will: I want to understand if the story was ruined by the movie adaptation (which is my guess) or if it was dull from the beginning.<br /><br />I disagree with most of the positive comments that defined the movie as a masterpiece. I simply don\\'t see the reasons why. What I see are many flaws, and a sample of them follows.<br /><br />1) The three main characters are thrown at you and it\\'s very hard to understand what drives them when making their choices.<br /><br />2) The \\\\\"secondary\\\\\" characters are there just to fill the gaps but they don\\'t add nothing to the story and you wonder if they are really necessary.<br /><br />3) I did not like how Tomas was impersonated. Nothing is good for him. He is so self-centered and selfish. He is not human, in some sense. But when his self-confidence fails and he realizes that he depends on others and is emotionally linked to someone, I did not find the interpretation credible.<br /><br />4) It\\'s very unlikely that an artist like Sabina could afford her lifestyle in a communist country in 1968. On top of that, the three main characters are all very successful in their respective professions, which sounds strange to me. a) how can Tereza become effortlessly such a good photographer? b) how can they do so well in a country lacking all the economic incentives that usually motivate people to succeed?<br /><br />5) The fake accents of the English spoken by the actors are laughable. And I am not even mother tongue. Moreover, the letter that Sabina receives while in the US is written in Czech, which I found very inconsistent.<br /><br />6) Many comments praised the movie saying that Prague was beautifully rendered: I guess that most of the movie was shot on location, so it\\'s not difficult to give the movie a Eastern European feeling, and given the intrinsic beauty of Prague is not even difficult to make it look good.<br /><br />7) I found the ending sort of trivial. Tereza and Tomas, finally happy in the countryside, far away from the temptations of the \\\\\"metropoly\\\\\", distant from the social struggles their fellow citizens are living, detached from their professional lives, die in a car accident. But they die after having realized that they are happy, indeed. So what? Had they died unhappy, would the message of the movie have been different? I don\\'t think so. I considered it sort of a cheap trick to please the audience.<br /><br />8) The only thing in the movie which is unbearably light is the way the director has portrayed the characters. You see them for almost three hours, but in the end you are left with nothing. You don\\'t feel empathy, you don\\'t relate to them, you are left there in your couch watching a sequence of events and scenes that have very little to say.<br /><br />9) I hated the \\\\\"stop the music in the restaurant\\\\\" scene (which some comments praised a lot). Why Sabina has got such a strong reaction? Why Franz agrees with her? I really don\\'t see the point. The only thing you learn is that Sabina has got a very bad temper and quite a strong personality. That\\'s it. What\\'s so special and unique about it?<br /><br />After all these negative comments, let me point tout that there are two scenes that I liked a lot (that\\'s why I gave it a two).<br /><br />The \\\\\"Naked women Photoshoot\\\\\", where the envy, the jealousy, and the insecurities of Sabina and Tereza are beautifully presented.<br /><br />The other scene is the one representing the investigations after the occupation of Prague by the Russians. Tereza pictures, taken to let the world know about what is going on in Prague, are used to identify the people taking part to the riots. I found it quite original and Tereza\\'s sense of despair and guilt are nicely portrayed.<br /><br />Finally, there is a tiny possibility that the movie was intentionally \\\\\"designed\\\\\" in such a way that \\\\\"Tomas types\\\\\" are going to like it and \\\\\"Tereza ones\\\\\" are going to hate it. If this is the case (I strongly doubt it, though) then my comment should be revised drastically.\"'],\n",

Tony\\'s Felix Unger obviously could be annoying some of the time. However, in the TV series, it related to specific situations where the annoyance was needed in the storyline. Jack\\'s Felix Ungar, (note the different spelling) in the movie, seems to never be happy, fun, or interesting. The movie Felix Ungar is a roommate that drives you up the wall, all the time.<br /><br />The movie still has great moments that withstand the test of time, the \\\\\"famous\\\\\" meatloaf fight is one of the greatest scenes ever! One of the other great examples of Felix\\'s \\\\\"little notes\\\\\" on Oscar\\'s pillow will be remembered forever. However, there are some darker sides where Oscar goes over the top, His \\\\\"crying\\\\\" near the end after bawling out Felix, and a scene involving Felix\\'s Linguine dinner, (although lightened by a funny line.) seem more depressing than comical.<br /><br />Perhaps there wasn\\'t enough time to see the lighter side of these characters that made the series so memorable in the movie. The beginning 20 minutes are very boring. The same issue occurs with Felix\\'s conversation with the Pidgeon Sisters. The movie\\'s ending is predictable and too pat. There\\'s very little care or compassion for each of them by the other. The result is that the darker side of the film leads to a lot of depression and anger, rather than comedy, unless you are watching the great scenes described above. It appears that Jack Lemmon\\'s monotone persona of Felix brings the film down, rather than enhances or embraces the comedy between the characters.<br /><br />It really took the 1970\\'s TV series to make The Odd Couple the best that it could be. The original film is still very good. However, the TV series is much better.\"'],\n",

This is a challenging, provocative movie that does not wrap things up neatly. The problem with the movie is in its structure. Its inpenetrable plot seems to be winding up, just as a second ending is tacked on. Though everything is technically dazzling, the movie is exactly too long by that unit. The long-delayed climax of Leo\\'s awakening comes about 20 minutes late.<br /><br />Great cinematography often comes at the expense of a decent script, but here the innovative camera technique offers a wealth of visual ideas.

Or was it? Time, of course, has a way of modifying perspectives, and with so many films today verily ulcerating with social and political commentary, there is a natural curiosity to wonder about controversy in older, seemingly less provocative films. In \\\\\"Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House,\\\\\" there may, therefore, be more than what audiences were looking for in 1948. There is political commentary, however subtle. Finding a house in the late 40s was a truly exasperating experience, only lightly softened by the coming of Levittowns and the like. Politics in the movie? The Blandings children always seem to be talking about progressive ideas being taught to them in school (which in real life would get teachers accused of communism). In real life, too, Myrna Loy was a housing activist, a Democrat, and a feminist. Melvyn Douglas was no less a Democratic firebrand: he was married to congresswoman Helen Gahagan Douglas, whom young Richard Nixon accused of being soft on communism (and which ruined her). Jason Robards, sr., has a small role in the film, but his political activism was no less noticeable. More importantly, his son, Jason Robards, jr., would be for many years a very active liberal Democrat. Almost the odd fellow out was Cary Grant, whose strident conservatism reflected a majority political sentiment in Hollywood that was already slipping. But this was 1948: Communism was a real perceived threat and the blacklist was just around the corner. It would be another decade before political activism would reappear in mainstream films, and then not so subtly.\"'],\n",

The film takes in elements of fantasy, horror, comedy and romance, all stirred together into a constantly entertaining package. Ching Siu Tung, directing and handling the choreography gives some neat wirework thrills, and fills the film with mists, shadows and eerily enthralling benighted forest colours, giving every forest scene a wonderfully bewitching atmosphere.

The \\\\\"prime suspects\\\\\" -- an eccentric professor, a radio broadcaster -- are simply annoying.<br /><br />Even the established comic book \\\\\"regulars\\\\\" are superfluous. It is hard to discern much romance between Vicki Vale and Bruce Wayne. Despite the perils she faces, Vicki displays virtually no emotion. Commissioner Gordon is none-too-bright. Unlike in the previous serial, Alfred the butler is a mere walk-on whose most important line is \\\\\"Mr Wayne\\'s residence.\\\\\" They are props for a drawn-out, gimmick-laden, incoherent plot, further saddled with uninspired, repetitive music and amateurish production design. The Wayne Manor exterior resembles a suburban middle-class home in any sitcom, the interiors those of a cheap roadside motel. The Batcave is an office desperately in need of refurbishing. (The costumes are kept rolled up in a filing cabinet!)<br /><br />Pity that the filmmakers couldn\\'t invest more effort into creating a thrilling adventure. While the availability of the two serials on DVD is a plus for any serious \\\\\"Batfan,\\\\\" one should not be fooled by the excellent illustrations on the box. They capture more of the authentic mood of the comic book than all 15 chapters of BATMAN AND ROBIN combined.<br /><br />Now for the good news -- this is not the 1997 version!\"'],\n",
